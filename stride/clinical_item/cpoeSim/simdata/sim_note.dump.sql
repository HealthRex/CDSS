1	1	2001	1500	0	  Mr. "B" is a 72 yo man with h/o CHF and CAD, who presented with increasing lower\nextremity edema and weight gain.\n<p> <b>HPI: </b> Mr. "B" has a long history of CHF subsequent to multiple MI's\nlast in 1991. Cardiac cath at that time revealed occlusions in LAD, OMB, and\ncirc with EF of 50%%. ECHO in 1996 showed a dilated LV, EF of 20-25%%, diffuse\nregional wall motion abnormalities, 2+MR and trace TR. His CHF has been managed\nmedically with captopril, lasix, metolazone, and digoxin. Over the past 6mos\nhe has required increasing doses of lasix to control his edema. He was seen\n2 wks ago by his Cardiologist, at which time he was noted to have leg, scrotal\nand penile edema. His lasix dose was increaed to 120 bid without relief of his\nswelling.\n<p>\n\nOver the past week he and his wife have noticed an increase in his LE edema which then became markedly worse in the past two days.  The swelling was accompanied by a weight gain of 10lb in 2 days (175 to 185lb) as well as a decrease in his exercise tolerance.  He now becomes dyspneic when rising to get out of bed and has to rest due to SOB when walking on flat ground.  He has 2 pillow orthopnea, denies PND.  His chronic cough has worsened and is now productive of "transparent" sputum with no hemoptysis.  He has occ audible wheeze.  Denies CP/pressure/palpitations/diaphoresis.  Occ nausea/no vomiting.  He eats limited quantities but does not salt or fluid restrict--eating canned soup and drinking 6-8 glasses liquid/day.  He has increased urinary freq. but decreased amount.  He states he has been taking all prescribed medications.<p>\n\n<table  width="90%%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<!-- Row 1 Column 1 -->\n\t\t<td valign = top>\n\t\t\tPMH:\n\t\t</td>\n\t\t<!-- Row 1 Column 2 -->\n\t\t<td >\n\t\t\tCHF: as above<br>\n\t\t\tMI<br>\n\t\t\tAfib: on coumadin<br>\n\t\t\tPacemaker placed in 3/93 for afib/flutter and slow ventricular response<br>\n\t\t\tHTN<br>\n\t\t\tChronic renal insufficiency:  BUN/Cr stable on 1/21/98, 52/1.4<br>\n\t\t\tDM: controlled with glyburide.

His symptoms are most consistent with incrasing CHF-biventricular-which would account for both his pulmonary congestion as well as his peripheral edema.  His renal disease is a less likely explanation for his extensive edema as his BUN/Cr have remained stable throughout.  However, his low albumin which could contribute to his edema may be due to renal losses.<p>\n\nSo if his edema is due to CHF, why has it become gradually and now acutely worse?  Possibilities include: 1) worsening LV function, 2) another MI, 3) worsening valvular disease, 4) poor compliance with medications or 5) excess salt and water intake.  His ECHO today shows no change in his EF, but there is marked wall motion abnormalities with akinesis.  There is no evidence in his history, EKG, or enzymes for current ischemia/infarct.  He does have MR and TR and his valvular disease may in part account for his worsening symptoms though his estimated PA pressure is unchanged and his LA is not dilated.  The most likely precipitant of his failure is a combination of poor compliance with medication and fluid overload from excessive intake.  We will continue to investigate the possibility of a structural precipitant for his deterioration and treat his current symptoms.<p>\n\n<ol type="1">\n<li>Pulm: his wheezing, crackles, and oxygen requirement are all likely\ndue to pulmonary congestion from LV dysfunction.

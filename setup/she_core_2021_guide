<h1 style="font-size:60px;">1. Copying tables</h1>

The first step is to simply all tables with the prefix of ```lpch_``` in their name under the database ```som-nero-phi-naras-ric:Jon_Chen_data_Oct_2021```. To copy the tables, click on the tables name under the Explorer section. Then click on the coppy button and select the new name and destination. I followed this process and coppied all lpch tables under a new database I created under ```som-nero-phi-jonc101``` called ```lpch_core_2021```.

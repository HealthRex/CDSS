The first step is to simply copy all tables under the database ```som-nero-phi-naras-ric:Jon_Chen_data_Oct_2021``` with the prefix of ```lpch_``` in the table name.

To copy these tables, click on the tables name under the Explorer section; click on the copy button, and select the new name and destination. 
I followed this process and coppied all lpch tables under a new database I created under ```som-nero-phi-jonc101``` called ```lpch_core_2021```.

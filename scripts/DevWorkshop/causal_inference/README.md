# A Practical Introduction to Causal Inference and Estimation Theory Through Code

Welcome to the tutorial on causal inference and estimation theory. This tutorial provides an introduction to causal inference and relevant estimation theory using a practical, code-focused approach, complemented by figures and tables. We will explain key concepts using a well-known example from medical research and show how to calculate the Average Treatment Effect using various estimators.

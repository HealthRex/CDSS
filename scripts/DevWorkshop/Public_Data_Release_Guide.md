### Steps for Making EHR Dataset Publicly Available at Stanford:

1. **Submit a Ticket to the University Privacy Office (UPO):**
    - Open a ticket with the University Privacy Office (UPO) through their service portal. Here is the link to submit a UPO request.
    - Include background details about your dataset and project when submitting the ticket.
2. **Provide Information to UPO:**
    - Once the ticket is opened, the UPO will reach out to gather more information about your dataset, such as:
        - Volume of data (e.g., number of patients).
        - Type of data (structured or unstructured).
        - Data elements included (e.g., demographics, comorbidities, etc.).
        - Consent and de-identification methods.
    - You may be asked to provide specific details or have a meeting to explain the structure and de-identification of your dataset.
3. **Meeting with UPO:**
    - Schedule a meeting with UPO to discuss your dataset and demonstrate the level of de-identification.
    - During the meeting, explain the dataset structure, clarify any questions they may have, and show compliance with de-identification standards (such as aggregating sensitive information like age over 89).
4. **Complete Data Risk Assessment (DRA):**
    - After the consultation with UPO, complete the [Data Risk Assessment (DRA)](https://uit.stanford.edu/security/dra) form. This form assesses potential risks associated with handling the data and ensures compliance with privacy standards.
    - Submit the DRA for review.
5. **Finalize Dataset Preparation:**
    - Ensure that the dataset is de-identified according to the agreed-upon methods, such as removing or anonymizing personally identifiable information (PII) and protected health information (PHI).
    - Make sure any sensitive fields, such as age groups, are grouped accordingly (e.g., ages over 89 are combined into one group).
6. **Prepare a Data Management Plan:**
    - Before making the dataset publicly available, prepare a formal Data Management Plan (DMP). This plan should outline:
        - How the data has been de-identified.
        - How it will be shared.
        - Retention periods and disposal methods in compliance with institutional policies.
7. **Public Release on PhysioNet/Dryad:
    - Once all steps are completed, you can upload the de-identified dataset to Dryad or another approved platform for public access.

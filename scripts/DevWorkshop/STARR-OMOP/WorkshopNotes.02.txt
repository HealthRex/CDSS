- Epic is only one vendor for hospital, of 400+
  Databases: Chronicles -> Clarity -> STRIDE
  (Epic Hyperspace is GUI interfacing with Chronicles)
  10,000+ tables
- STRIDE homegrown model that extracts out samples of Clarity tables more likely to be relevant for researchers. Developed (2003) before OMOP and other common data models. Back then, very siloed incidental hospital contacts.
- STRIDE homegrown system taking data streams from Clarity as well as HL7 feeds from other systems

- Storage and compute is cheap now, so able to ask questions now that were previously impractical.
- STRIDE was housed on-premises in an Oracle database
- Now want to expand to not just EMR. Radiology images, pathology images. On-premises compute not scalable, so migrating to cloud compute environment.

- Current permissions to get data into cloud
  Clarity LPCH
  Clairty SHC
  PACS Dicom
  CGS
  Philips Waveform
  Power Path pathology
- Other data sources in 400+ that are still siloed, but trying to consolidate

- Aim to put all queryable metadata into BigQuery, adapted into OMOP data model where possible


- RIT - Backend infrastructure to manage data. Building STARR-OMOP data lake. Have deidentified STARR-OMOP database, which allows preliminary to research interaction even more than cohort tool.
- RIC - Used to be part of RIT, but separated out to be the "data vendor." Not involved with how data is setup, they just run SQL queries to pull out samples for users
- SRCC - Worked with SOM to make Nero, PHI compliant platform beyond just Box folders


Resource Naming
- STARR-OMOP: Identified clarity data from two hospitals in OMOP CDM. Can only access subsets for specific IRB approved projects?
- STARR-OMOP-deid: De-identified version + clinical text and annotations, so risk of incidental PHI. Still High-Risk
- STARR-OMOP-deid-Lite: Above without clinical text and annotations
  (Very similar to STARR-Tahoe datalake that PHS was hosting, except with OMOP formatting)
- STARR-OMOP de-id Lite 1%

Risk Classifications (can be institution specific)
- https://uit.stanford.edu/guide/riskclassifications
- Low Risk - Publicly available, doesn't matter if disclose
- Medium Risk - Not if if disclosed, not generally available
- High Risk - Stanford has legal requirements to protect and would have to report/investigate if disclose.

  HIPAA Identifiers
  - Name
  - Dates
  - Telephone
  - Geopgrahic
  - SSN

= OMOP Common Data Model =
Concept Table - One True Code Table
- Fields named "_code" are the original source strings (e.g., ICD9, ICD10, SNOMED codes, MeSH, etc.), whereas  "_ID"
fields reference OMOP unique concept_id sequence numbers, meant to be a universal global ID.


ATHENA tool for public browsing of concept relationships
- http://athena.ohdsi.org

RX Nav
- Browse through option of RxNorm drug relationships
- Or directly query traverse OMOP concept table and concept_ancestor tables to find items with component ingredients

Brief HPI - Per Admission H&P:
As per admission H&P dated X/XX/2025:
 
"Patient was previously admitted on XX due to progressive fatigue and fevers. He was found to have GPR bacteremia, positive cocci antibodies, and cavitary pulmonary lesions. His admission was complicated by AKI on CKD, pancytopenia, and HSM, bacteremia (Brevibacterium and Microbacterium) likely secondary to CLABSI, s/p 8d of vanc. A bone marrow biopsy was performed on XX to evaluate the pancytopenia. Bone marrow results were equivocal. Patient noticed bleeding from the biopsy site starting 2 days ago. However, he did not change his wound dressing after discharge from his previous admission up until 2 days ago, so unclear if bleeding had been ongoing for longer.
 
Since discharge on XX, the patient reports a week of worsening fatigue, dizziness, poor oral intake, and subjective fevers. He describes feeling the need to remain in bed and is unable to perform household chores / ADLs, which he typically manages with some assistance from his son.  He denies any nausea or vomiting, chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain or dysuria however did endorse some R CVA tenderness. He reports reduced ostomy output over the past two days, but he is continuing to produce urine. He is on TPN due to his short gut syndrome and has been eating occasionally, with grapefruit being his most recent food intake. 
 
He was found to have severe AKI with Cr of 8, baseline 6-7, on admission. He was feeling worse yesterday and he decided to seek medical attention today. "
 
Hospital Course Summary
 
Overall, hospitalization course was uncomplicated. He remained afebrile and his vital signs remained stable during his hospitalization. His BMBx site was monitored and not observed to actively bleed or exhibit signs of infection during his hospitalization. He continued to eat/was on TPN during his hospitalization.
 
A broad workup for patient's AKI on CKD was conducted given his elevated Cr at 8 on admission. At baseline, patient's serum creatinine levels fluctuate between 6-7. Per nephrology consult, believed that patient's current AKI presentation to be 2/2 to recurrent pre-renal AKI. Recommendations from nephrology were followed, including fluid repletion with LR based on orthostatic blood pressure measurements with the goal of keeping patient net even to slightly positive daily. We continued to trend patient's Cr and as he was able to recover to his baseline on 8/4 with recommendations, nephrology cleared patient for discharge from nephrology standpoint with recommendations to receive dialysis outpatient after outpatient nephrology follow-up. Given patient's constellation of symptoms with previous/current hospitalization (pulm lesions, AKI, and pancytopenia), in addition to previously obtained RF and PR3 autoimmune markers that were positive, we also conducted a workup for possible vasculitis, with rheumatology recommendations, as an alternative etiology for patient's AKI. Ultimately, workup was significant for low C3/C4 however further workup was cleared to be continued outpatient. A TEE was also obtained to evaluate for possible endocarditis given his history of recurrent central line infections, which returned negative. Finally, any postrenal obstructive etiologies were ruled out with renal ultrasound which revealed findings that were deemed stable compared to prior per nephrology.
 
Discharge Plan, by Issue:
 
# Pre-renal AKI on CKD
# Uremia
Baseline of CKD5 2/2 hypertensive nephrosclerosis, chronic tubulointerstitial disease, and recurrent AKIs (per nephro note, prone to pre-renal injury in s/o short gut syndrome, malnutrition). On admission, Cr level of 8, elevated from his baseline Cr of 6-7. BUN around 80s-90s. Based on lab values, BUN/Cr ~10, FeNA of 18%, significantly elevated urine albumin/cr ratio, consistent with an intrinsic AKI.
 
Broad workup for AKI conducted. UA 3+ protein, 2+ blood, no casts, stable compared to prior. No pyuria, no dysuria. Blood cx no growth x2. Low concern for infection at this time. Renal ultrasound conducted to exclude post-renal process, revealing of mild/moderate R hydronephrosis, BL nonobstructing renal calculi. Per nephro note, this is chronic and findings are stable compared to prior. Patient is not on any tubulo-toxic drugs however vasculitis was considered as possible etiology for intrinsic AKI given patient's pulm lesions/pancytopenia. Of note, patient had isolated PR3, positive RF but negative ANCA and MPO, prompting a workup for possible vasculitis however returned unremarkable with rheumatology recommending follow-up outpatient. Intrinsic picture may also be 2/2 to recurrent pre-renal AKI.
 
Nephrology evaluated patient and per their note, believed that this current AKI is likely ischemic due to poor PO intake, volume depletion. Recommendations were followed including orthostats to guide fluid administration with LR to main euvolemia, strict I/Os and bladder scans, ESA 20K units subQ every 7 days, goal Hgb 9-11. Ultimately, nephrology felt that there were no urgent indications for dialysis but expected patient to need dialysis sooner than he will be able to obtain a fistula recommending expedited TDC placement within 2 weeks.
- Follow up with nephrology outpatient, possible TDC placement
 
 
 
# Anemia of chronic disease
# Pancytopenia
# Bleeding
Baseline Hgb around 8. Elevated iron of 220. TIBC decreased 240. Increased transferrin sat of 90. Ferritin elevated at 1200. Patient likely has an anemia of chronic disease given his h/o Crohn's and malnutrition d/t short gut syndrome, also likely iso of ESRD. He was severely iron deficient during his last admission and he previously received IV iron. BMBx was obtained during patient's most recent admission to workup pancytopenia however was unremarkable. Autoimmune workup was also conducted per above to evaluate for possible autoimmune etiology to pancytopenia.
- Continue to monitor CBCs outpatient
 
 

# Crohn's s/p small bowel resection c/b short gut
# chronic TPN
# malnutrition
Patient has short gut syndrome and has poor PO intake, requiring chronic TPN and LR infusions at home. TPN regimen was adjusted to ensure patient remains euvolemic outpatient.
- Continue TPN
- ensure sufficient PO intake to maintain euvolemia / or ~ net positive +500mL
 
 
 
# h/o pulmonary cavitary lesions, pancytopenia, renal disease
# rheumatologic process?
Pt found to have cavitary pulmonary lesions in previous admission that improved with treatment of brevibacterium bacteremia. It was thought that the lesions were due to septic emboli from his central line blood stream infection. Previous fungal workup was negative.
Pt remained asymptomatic during his hospitalization.
 
Differential diagnosis for syndromes encompassing pulmonary, hematologic, and renal disease include autoimmune vasculitis (granulomatosis with polyangiitis, PR3-ANCA vasculitis), infectious etiologies (TB, fungal), malignancy, sarcoidosis. Workup significant for low C3/C4 however rheumatology recommended to continue follow up outpatient.

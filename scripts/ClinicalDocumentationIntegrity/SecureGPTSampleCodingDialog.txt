Given this Discharge Summary, let's see if we can identify some Relevant Clinical Conditions for explicit coding

...


Based on the provided discharge summary, here are the relevant clinical conditions that can be explicitly coded:

1. **Crohn's Disease** - History of Crohn's disease, status post small bowel resection, leading to short gut syndrome.
2. **Short Gut Syndrome** - Resulting from the surgical intervention for Crohn's disease, requiring chronic total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
3. **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** - Stage 5 CKD secondary to hypertensive nephrosclerosis and chronic tubulointerstitial disease.
4. **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)** - Presenting as AKI on CKD during this admission.
5. **Anemia of Chronic Disease** - Likely due to chronic illness and malnutrition associated with Crohn's disease and short gut syndrome.
6. **Pancytopenia** - Documented during hospitalization, with a bone marrow biopsy performed to evaluate the cause.
7. **GPR Bacteremia** - Positive for Gram-positive cocci bacteremia, likely secondary to central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
8. **Cavitary Pulmonary Lesions** - Found during previous admissions, possibly related to septic emboli from bacteremia.
9. **Hypertension** - History of hypertension, managed with amlodipine.
10. **Malnutrition** - Due to short gut syndrome and poor oral intake.
11. **Bleeding from Bone Marrow Biopsy Site** - Ongoing oozing from the biopsy site noted during hospitalization.
12. **Possible Vasculitis** - Workup for vasculitis due to the combination of pulmonary, hematologic, and renal symptoms, with positive rheumatoid factor and PR3-ANCA.
13. **Chronic Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN)** - Ongoing requirement for nutritional support due to short gut syndrome.

These conditions should be documented and coded appropriately for accurate medical records and billing purposes.




Copied below is a list of many relevant clinical conditions important for coding. Which of these do the Discharge Summary justify? # Example Relevant Clinical Conditions checklist that gets asked for patients

...


Based on the discharge summary provided, the following relevant clinical conditions from the checklist can be justified:

1. **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)** - Present on admission, as the patient was found to have severe AKI with a creatinine level of 8, elevated from a baseline of 6-7.
2. **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** - The patient has a history of CKD, specifically Stage 5, which is noted in the discharge summary.
3. **Pancytopenia** - Documented during hospitalization, with a bone marrow biopsy performed to evaluate the cause.
4. **Anemia of Chronic Disease** - Likely due to the patient's history of Crohn's disease and malnutrition associated with short gut syndrome.
5. **Bacteremia** - The patient had GPR bacteremia (Gram-positive cocci), which was confirmed during the hospitalization.
6. **Sepsis** - The patient presented with subjective fevers and malaise, which could indicate sepsis, especially given the bacteremia.
7. **Malnutrition** - The patient has short gut syndrome and poor oral intake, requiring chronic TPN, which indicates malnutrition.
8. **Bleeding** - Ongoing oozing from the bone marrow biopsy site was noted during hospitalization.
9. **Possible Vasculitis** - Workup for vasculitis was conducted due to the combination of pulmonary, hematologic, and renal symptoms, with positive rheumatoid factor and PR3-ANCA.
10. **Cavitary Pulmonary Lesions** - Found during previous admissions, possibly related to septic emboli from bacteremia.

These conditions are relevant to the patient's clinical care and treatment plan during the hospitalization and should be documented and coded accordingly.





Would the patient satisfy criteria for Severe Protein Calorie Malnutrition? The ASPEN criteria would include: Insufficient energy intake: The patient's calorie intake is inadequate for their needs.
Weight loss: Evidence of unintentional weight loss over a specific period.
Loss of muscle mass: A reduction in muscle mass, observable through physical examination.
Loss of subcutaneous fat: The reduction of fat under the skin.
Diminished functional status: Often measured by reduced hand-grip strength, indicating decreased physical capacity.
Localized or generalized fluid accumulation: Swelling or edema, which can mask weight loss.




Based on the information provided in the discharge summary, the patient may indeed satisfy the criteria for Severe Protein Calorie Malnutrition according to the ASPEN criteria. Hereâ€™s an evaluation of each criterion:

1. **Insufficient Energy Intake**: The patient has a history of short gut syndrome and poor oral intake, requiring chronic TPN (total parenteral nutrition). This indicates that the patient's calorie intake is likely inadequate for their needs.

2. **Weight Loss**: While specific weight loss data is not provided in the summary, the patient reports worsening fatigue and decreased oral intake, which could suggest unintentional weight loss. If there is documented weight loss over a specific period, this would support the diagnosis.

3. **Loss of Muscle Mass**: The summary does not explicitly mention muscle mass loss, but the patient's overall condition, including fatigue and decreased ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs), may suggest muscle wasting. A physical examination would be necessary to assess this.

4. **Loss of Subcutaneous Fat**: There is no specific mention of subcutaneous fat loss in the summary. However, a physical examination would be needed to evaluate this aspect.

5. **Diminished Functional Status**: The patient describes feeling the need to remain in bed and is unable to perform household chores or ADLs without assistance, indicating diminished functional status.

6. **Localized or Generalized Fluid Accumulation**: The summary does not mention any edema or fluid accumulation, so this criterion may not be satisfied unless there is evidence of swelling that is not documented.

In summary, the patient likely meets several of the ASPEN criteria for Severe Protein Calorie Malnutrition, particularly regarding insufficient energy intake, diminished functional status, and potentially weight loss and muscle mass loss. A comprehensive assessment, including physical examination and possibly additional laboratory evaluations, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.




Does the patient have Acute Hepatic Failure? This would typically be indicated by rising levels of transaminases like AST and ALT as well as other functional indicators of hepatic function such as an increased INR



Based on the discharge summary provided, there is no indication that the patient has Acute Hepatic Failure. Here are the relevant points regarding hepatic function from the summary:

1. **Liver Function Tests (LFTs)**: The most recent LFTs show:
   - **AST**: 35
   - **ALT**: 24
   - **Alkaline Phosphatase (ALKP)**: 146 (elevated)
   - **Total Bilirubin (TBIL)**: 1.1
   - **Albumin**: 3.1 (slightly low)

   The AST and ALT levels are within normal limits and do not indicate acute liver injury. Typically, acute hepatic failure would be associated with significantly elevated transaminases (AST and ALT), often in the hundreds or thousands.

2. **INR**: The INR is reported as 1.1, which is within the normal range (typically 0.8-1.2). An increased INR would suggest impaired hepatic synthetic function, which is a key indicator of hepatic failure.

3. **Clinical Context**: The patient does not exhibit signs or symptoms typically associated with acute hepatic failure, such as jaundice, confusion, or coagulopathy.

In conclusion, the laboratory values and clinical context provided in the discharge summary do not support a diagnosis of Acute Hepatic Failure. The liver function appears to be stable, and there are no significant indicators of hepatic dysfunction.




Would the code for Adult failure to thrive be justified?



Based on the information provided in the discharge summary, the code for **Adult Failure to Thrive** may be justified. Here are the relevant considerations:

1. **Poor Oral Intake**: The patient has a history of short gut syndrome and has been experiencing decreased oral intake, which is a significant factor contributing to failure to thrive.

2. **Worsening Fatigue and Diminished Functional Status**: The patient reports worsening fatigue and describes feeling the need to remain in bed, indicating a decline in functional status. This aligns with the characteristics of failure to thrive.

3. **Malnutrition**: The patient is on chronic total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to short gut syndrome, which suggests that they are unable to meet their nutritional needs through oral intake alone. This is a critical component of failure to thrive.

4. **Weight Loss**: While specific weight loss data is not provided, the patient's overall condition and decreased ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) may suggest unintentional weight loss, which is often associated with failure to thrive.

5. **Age and Comorbidities**: The patient is 62 years old and has multiple comorbidities, including Crohn's disease, chronic kidney disease, and anemia, which can contribute to a decline in overall health and nutritional status.

Given these factors, the diagnosis of Adult Failure to Thrive appears to be supported by the clinical information provided in the discharge summary. It would be appropriate to document and code for this condition, especially considering the patient's significant nutritional challenges and functional decline.

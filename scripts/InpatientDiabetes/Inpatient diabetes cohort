Cohort of patients where subQ, inpatient insulin was ordered and given (>0 units), attempting to exclude pump insulin, excluding any insulin ordered <10x total in the dataset, and excluding any patient encounters in which the creatinine rose >2 

	Number of insulin doses recorded as given & 0 units: 123
	Number of unique patients: 39083 
		- 39087 when dose of insulin given 0 or greater

		- Number of insulin doses marked as given (including 0 units given): 1014698
	Range of insulin doses: 1 (exlcuded anything <1)- 50000 (incorrectly recorded heparin) --> Will exclude doses > 100 (Church & Haines 2016, can't absorb more than ~80U)

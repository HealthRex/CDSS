MyHealth messages are good for questions that can we can quickly answer in a sentence or two. However, we generally need an appointment for anything that requires a lengthier explanation, or for anything that requires us to ask questions or have a back-and-forth conversation (such as prescribing a new medication, ordering tests, or determining what the cause of someone's symptoms might be). Additionally, specialists and/or insurances typically require that we complete a recent evaluation for an issue in our office first before placing a referral for that issue. For example, audiology and/or ENT may want us to complete an ear exam before placing a referral to evaluate whether there is something going on inside your ears that might be causing hearing issues.Since it appears you have PPO insurance, you can see if your insurance will let you self-refer to a covered provider. However that specialist might still require a referral from us (even though insurance doesn't) so that they have a summary of the issue.I will forward your message along to our schedulers who should reach out to you to help set up an appointment. Alternatively, feel free to schedule an appointment using the MyHealth app, or by giving us a call at 510-521-2300.Take care, Alameda Family Physicians Clinical Care TeamPlease note that MyHealth messages are meant for non-urgent concerns that can be answered by a simple email response.

MyHealth messages are good for questions that can we can quickly answer in a sentence or two. However, we generally need an appointment for anything that requires a lengthier explanation, or for anything that requires us to ask questions or have a back-and-forth conversation (such as prescribing a new medication, ordering tests, or determining what the cause of someone's symptoms might be). Additionally, specialists and/or insurances typically require that we complete a recent evaluation for an issue in our office first before placing a referral for that issue. For example, audiology and/or ENT may want us to complete an ear exam before placing a referral to evaluate whether there is something going on inside your ears that might be causing hearing issues.Since it appears you have PPO insurance, you can see if your insurance will let you self-refer to a covered provider.

Are you purposely not scheduling these tests this year?Also, I don't think we've ever tested for Hemoglobin A1c. I read that should be done after age 35 or so. Is that not the case.Lastly, the earliest, early morning (8 AM) lab appointment I could get is after my scheduled annual Medicare physical.

      "Hi Don, This is Irene Kwan, FNP-C responding on behalf of Dr. John Carper. In general, sometimes certain lab tests are not always ordered on a yearly basis, and only ordered if clinically necessary.  For example, CBC may not be needed if there is no sign of fatigue, weakness, blood loss, history of anemia, or concerning presence of infection. Sometimes Medicare also does not cover for certain tests if deemed not medically necessary or at risk, thus patients may have to pay out of pocket for tests requested by the patient. Your metabolic panel test will check for a fasting blood sugar, and if it is elevated, then we can always check hemoglobin A1c with a fingerstick blood check in office. Your labs ordered on 11/1/2024 are recommended to be fasting so that we can accurately check your glucose level and lipid (cholesterol) levels.  Thank you for your understanding, and should you have further questions about lab tests, it can be discussed at your upcoming appointment.

Please note, Your results will release immediately, likely before I can review them.  Once I review your results, which may be up to 3-4 business days, I will send comments regarding the results.    We can check another test to make sure your blood sugar average (A1C) is in normal range as your fasting and non-fasting blood sugar can react to when you ate, what you ate, stress, etc.  Your A1C has been ordered and sent electronically to Labcorp to be done non-fasting.  You do not need to have the paper orders, but you can print them out at home through MyHealth (under tests-> ordered tests).  You should try to schedule an appointment for your test at the lab (online or by phone), as they can be busy.  Your results will release immediately, likely before I can review them.  Once I review your results, which may be up to 3-4 business days, I will send comments regarding the results.    Your white blood cell count was slightly low, but improved from your previous which is usually low.  Your thyroid hormone, electrolytes, pancrease enzymes, liver and kidney function are normal.  Your H.pylori stool test is negative for infection.  Please follow up with Dr. Cheng regarding your GI symptoms.

      "Hi Dr. Tsao,I got my blood tests results yesterday, and I’m very worried that my Glucose is high. It was slightly outside the normal range for non-fasting, and way outside the normal range for fasting. I didn’t fast but the only thing I ate was oatmeal and eggs and it was about 4 hours before the blood draw so I was very surprised that the glucose level wasn’t closer to the normal fasting range, and I assume it’s related my pancreas function. As you know, I’m very worried about pancreatic cancer.I am eager to get your analysis about it, and any other concerns about other test results, and to move quickly on whatever next step I should take.I am still struggling to eat food and still feeling discomfort after I do eat. Thank you,Ritsuko\n",

      "HI Ritsuko, I have not been able review your results until now and did not see the email that you had sent. Please note, Your results will release immediately, likely before I can review them.  Once I review your results, which may be up to 3-4 business days, I will send comments regarding the results.    We can check another test to make sure your blood sugar average (A1C) is in normal range as your fasting and non-fasting blood sugar can react to when you ate, what you ate, stress, etc.  Your A1C has been ordered and sent electronically to Labcorp to be done non-fasting.  You do not need to have the paper orders, but you can print them out at home through MyHealth (under tests-> ordered tests).  You should try to schedule an appointment for your test at the lab (online or by phone), as they can be busy.  Your results will release immediately, likely before I can review them.  Once I review your results, which may be up to 3-4 business days, I will send comments regarding the results.    Your white blood cell count was slightly low, but improved from your previous which is usually low.  Your thyroid hormone, electrolytes, pancrease enzymes, liver and kidney function are normal.  Your H.pylori stool test is negative for infection.  Please follow up with Dr. Cheng regarding your GI symptoms. Lilian Li-Ning Tsao, MD, 10/21/2024, 8:39 AMI'm not in the office on Mondays, but check my inbox periodically.  \n",

Last time I went, I ended up getting pretty sick with what I think was food poisoning—lots of stomach issues, and I was basically stuck in my hotel room for a couple days. I want to be more prepared this time, so I’m wondering about any vaccines or medications I should get before I leave, especially to help avoid stomach bugs or other travel-related illnesses. Also, do I actually need to come in for an office visit to get this sorted, or would a video appointment work just as well? I’d like to schedule something soon since my trip is coming up, but going into the clinic might be tricky with my work schedule. Appreciate any advice!\n",

I’ve been feeling pretty tired lately, and I remember last year you had me on a high-dose vitamin D3 regimen because my levels were low. I just realized my prescription for the 50,000 IU weekly capsules has run out, and I’m not sure if it’s safe for me to just stop or try to switch to a lower-dose over-the-counter supplement. Would you be able to send in a new prescription for the 50,000 IU dose (the kind I take once a week)? I think it was for 6 weeks at a time before — is it possible to arrange for automatic renewals for the rest of the year, just so there’s no gap? I’ve also been having some minor muscle aches and trouble sleeping again, which is why I think it’d be good to stay on top of this. Let me know what you think! Thank you!\n",

      "Hello Margaret, Dr. Caceres is out of the office currently. I am one of the other physicians in clinic helping to cover her messages today.  She will be back in clinic next week. I placed some routine blood test orders for you including vitamin D which you can have completed at your convenience. Some insurances don't cover vitamin D as a routine screening lab, but it looks like you've had this checked before with your routine labs in the past so if you haven't had any issues before it shouldn't be an issue this time, but I like to give patient's a heads up that vitamin D tests are sometimes not covered. Please let us know if you have any questions. Best wishes, Kevin Lutley, MD \n",

Recently I talked to the heart rhythm nurse practitioner about the Zio heart rhythm data collection. She said she’d reach out to you regarding a referral to cardiology.  I’m not fully clear the reason why the referral since there was no incident of AFIB.  Would you mind elaborating further?3) I’m wondering if you have a recommendation regarding ear canal care regarding ear wax hygiene. I recently acquired hearing aids that get clogged. I did ask the audiologist this question.  4) I see a therapist from the list you provided. I have a session every other week.  Suzanne is a  soldier with infusion regiment and experienced  an unexpected lung and knee inflammation side effects,  hospitalization for two weeks.

      "2025-06-27 18:10:44,937 - query_message: Hi Dr. Manugian,I wanted to check in with a few things that have been on my mind lately. Last week, I went in for another neck ultrasound—my doctor said it was just to “monitor” some things from my last visit, but I wasn’t completely sure if they saw something new or if this is just routine. If you have any insights on what specifically they’re looking for, I’d really appreciate it.On another note, I’ve been in touch with the cardiac clinic about my recent Zio monitor recording. Even though I didn’t feel any episodes and haven’t been told I have AFib, they mentioned a possible follow-up with a cardiologist. Does this mean they found something they’re concerned about, or is it just standard protocol to get a second opinion?Switching gears, I recently started using hearing aids, and I’m having trouble keeping them clean—seems like ear wax builds up much faster now. The audiologist mentioned over-the-counter drops, but I’m worried about using those too often. Do you have any tips on how to manage ear wax, especially now that I’m wearing this device most of the day?Therapy-wise, I took your advice and started seeing someone regularly, which has really helped. Our family has had a rough patch recently—my sister, who’s undergoing infusion treatments, ended up in the hospital unexpectedly with some lung issues, and it’s thrown us all for a loop. The oncologist is thinking about pausing her treatments for a bit. All of this is weighing on me, especially as my kids are getting older and our routines are changing. Appreciate any guidance you can offer—thanks again for your support!Best,  Alex\n",

You can also log into MyHealth to schedule a same-day appointment with your PCP or Express Care Clinic. Express Care is open 9am-9pm 7 days/week.Earwax Blockage: Care InstructionsOverview Earwax is a natural substance that protects the ear canal. Normally, earwax drains from the ears and does not cause problems. Sometimes earwax builds up in the ear canal and hardens. Earwax blockage (also called cerumen impaction) can cause some loss of hearing and pain. When wax is tightly packed, you will need to have your doctor remove it.Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your doctor if you are having problems. It's also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.How can you care for yourself at home?Do not try to remove earwax with cotton swabs, fingers, or other objects. This can make the blockage worse and damage the eardrum.If your doctor recommends that you try to remove earwax at home:Soften and loosen the earwax with warm mineral oil. You also can try hydrogen peroxide mixed with an equal amount of room temperature water. Place 2 drops of the fluid, warmed to body temperature, in the ear two times a day for up to 5 days.Once the wax is loose and soft, all that is usually needed to remove it from the ear canal is a gentle, warm shower. Direct the water into the ear, then tip your head to let the earwax drain out. Use a towel to gently dry your ear.If the warm mineral oil and shower do not work, use an over-the-counter wax softener. Read and follow all instructions on the label. After using the wax softener, use an ear syringe to gently flush the ear. Make sure the flushing solution is body temperature. Cool or hot fluids in the ear can cause dizziness.When should you call for help? Call your doctor now or seek immediate medical care if:  Pus or blood drains from your ear.   Your ears are ringing or feel full.   You have a loss of hearing. Watch closely for changes in your health, and be sure to contact your doctor if:  You have pain or reduced hearing after 1 week of home treatment.   You have any new symptoms, such as nausea or balance problems. Where can you learn more?Login to MyHealth at https://myhealth.stanfordhealthcare.org.

      "Hi Wes, Just following up on the rhythm clinic's recommendation. They requested referral to general cardiology to work up the non-sustained ventricular tachycardia episodes that were noted on the heart monitor. Often times general cardiology will start with a kind of stress test to evaluate for decreased blood flow to parts of the heart that can trigger these episodes. I went ahead and sent the referral for you.

      "Good afternoon,I really enjoyed our first meeting. Thank you for being my new PCP. There are three things remaining from our initial meeting.1. We did not have time to discuss my IT issue which started September 14. I still am having significant pain in my lower back and down my left leg. Wondering if an MRI is in order? 2. Can I get a blood test for alpha gal?3. I would like to transfer the cardiology care to Stanford also. My cardiologist referred me for ablation. Can you refer me within Stanford? Thanks so much and Happy Holidays\n",

I wanted to reach out because I’ve been having a hard time getting my Zepbound 5 mg filled on time—the pharmacy keeps saying it’s on backorder and sometimes there are delays. Last month I missed a dose by a couple of days because they didn’t have it when I needed it. Since I’ve started on Zepbound, I’ve really noticed improvement with my weight and my blood sugar is more stable, so I’m concerned about missing doses or interruptions in the treatment. Is there any way we can send in my next prescription a little early, or maybe even have a backup plan in case the pharmacy runs out again? I’m just anxious about keeping everything on track.

You may recall that early last year I asked for your help to try Zepbound (tirzepatide). I ended up transitioning to using the Noom program for food logging, coaching, and diet support. Through them, I've been doing Zepbound, lost about 20lbs and gotten my BMI in line. I'm now talking to them about titrating back down (and possibly off), but there is some glitch going on between them and UHC with the turn of the new year and UHC will not approve them as \"in-network\" to fill the prescription. I've been fighting this for a week and am now getting pretty desperate to just get it filled for Jan. as I can't go off cold turkey. Would you be willing to write me a prescription for Zepbound 7.5 to the CVS I have on file while this gets figured out by Noom and UHC? I recently had new tests done for thyroid, etc. and am happy to share if helpful. Thank you! Sarah\n",

      "Hi Dr. Weinlander, Sorry to send a bit of an out of the blue note, but I'm hoping I can get your help with renewal of a prescription. You may recall that early last year I asked for your help to try Zepbound (tirzepatide). I ended up transitioning to using the Noom program for food logging, coaching, and diet support. Through them, I've been doing Zepbound, lost about 20lbs and gotten my BMI in line. I'm now talking to them about titrating back down (and possibly off), but there is some glitch going on between them and UHC with the turn of the new year and UHC will not approve them as \"in-network\" to fill the prescription. I've been fighting this for a week and am now getting pretty desperate to just get it filled for Jan. as I can't go off cold turkey. Would you be willing to write me a prescription for Zepbound 7.5 to the CVS I have on file while this gets figured out by Noom and UHC? I recently had new tests done for thyroid, etc. and am happy to share if helpful. Thank you! Sarah\n",

      "Hello Doctor,  I have just started Pepcid from yesterday. Will know if it makes any difference by the time we have appointment on Thursday. I took a chest X-ray on Friday 11/8 ( at Radnet ) and images are available online but I dont see any report. Please do let me know if everything is fine with the X-ray. I dont have any chest tightness, but still shortness of breath if I climb stairs or talk while walking ( I didnt have any of these a few weeks before). I have my pulmonologist first appointment on 11/20\n",

      "Hello Doctor,  The abdominal pain issue subsided on its own after I removed Oats from diet and hence didnt go through the abdominal CT scan. I have another bigger issue though. I had tightness in chest and shortness of breath from 10/21. I contacted my cardiologist and they asked to get my EKG done in an urgent care nearby. I did the same and it was normal ( done on 10/23 ). The tightness is not all day.They have also asked me on 10/25 to schedule an CT angiogram. This is schedules on 11/4.My lung capacity has dropped and I am short of breath even after going up one flight of stairs which was not the case a couple of weeks ago.Do you think it would make sense to also have an appointment with a pulmonologist ? If yes, could you put a referral for the same ? \n",

      "Hi Manu,I'm glad to hear that your abdominal pain has subsided after adjusting your diet. Regarding your new symptoms of chest tightness and shortness of breath, it's good that you have already consulted with your cardiologist and have a CT angiogram scheduled.  The next basic workup step would be a chest xray-did they do that in the urgent care?  We will request records but I don't have access to them at this time.I went ahead an ordered a chest xray and put in a referral to pulmonology.  If the shortness of breath is worsening or becomes constant or is accompanied by pain please go immediately to the ER.  Take care, and please follow up with me by phone, video or in person appointment after you complete your chest xray.Jesse Amanda Rokicki Parashar, MD\n",

      "Hi Dr Jee,I’m not happy with the response that I’ve been receiving regarding this medication. Whomever is checking this message, I hope that they look at your response to me stating that you would make sure I got the right prescription, which is Advair HFA. I believe that someone actually did try to order Advair HFA again, but CVS then reached out to your office to understand why you were asking for Advair HFA. That is where everything seems to have come to a standstill. I then received a call a few days ago from an MA telling me that if I want this prescription that I have to schedule a video visit with you. I’m very confused if you already approved the prescription, why I’m now being asked to do a video visit. We already discussed my issues when I saw you a few weeks back,  and you already agreed that I should try Advair HFA in this thread. What is the point of a video visit? I just want the medication you agreed that I should try. Can someone please make this happen?\n",

      "Hi Dr. Jee - quick question, I got the Wegovy 0.50 dosage refill filled today.  I have 3 doses of 0.25 remaining from my last refill.  Does it make sense to increase my next injection to two (2) 0.25 pens and then move onto the 0.50 doses?  I’m working on the assumption that the refill schedule will continue as normal for the 0.50.

While it is probably not recommended by the manufacturer, it should essentially be the same thing to take two of the 0.25 mg doses as taking the 0.50 mg dose.If you have any other questions or need further clarification, feel free to reach out.Best,Olivia Jee, MDStanford Primary Care Los Altos\n",

      "Hello, I would like to follow up on US results which I never received. Also would like to confirm reason for appointment scheduled this coming Friday? Want to make sure there is a need for it? I can't remember why the appointment was made and what we were going to discuss. I can cancel if the appointment is not necessary. I don't have any concerns but, if previous lab result discussion is needed I can keep the appointment.thanks \n",

The hospital operator wasn’t able to transfer me, and now I’m stuck not knowing how to actually reach Dr. Murthy’s clinic to make an appointment.Could you please share Dr. Murthy’s direct office phone number or let me know the best way to contact his staff? I want to get scheduled soon because my symptoms are really starting to affect my daily life. Thanks so much for any help!\n",

The symptoms are a very runny nose and a wet cough, sometimes resulting in coughing out mucus.  I think I had a fever at one point last week, but I took Tylenol and it passed and has not recurred.  I'm most concerned about the duration of the symptoms.  It's very unusual for me to have a cold that lasts this long.  I did receive COVID and flu vaccines in the early Fall.My wife (also a patient of yours, Helen Rutt) is experiencing the same symptoms.  She came down with them a few days after I did.What should we do?  I hesitate to ask for an appointment for what is a mild cold, but this is a lingering mild cold.  I have not taken much in the way of over the counter cold meds, but will take whatever you recommend.  Hopefully what Helen and I have is something you are seeing in other patients and you can tell us what we should do.Thanks in advance.Best regards, Gil Ohana\n",

      "Hi Dr. Garay,I have had a persistent cough and cold for about the last 10-12 days.  The symptoms are a very runny nose and a wet cough, sometimes resulting in coughing out mucus.  I think I had a fever at one point last week, but I took Tylenol and it passed and has not recurred.  I'm most concerned about the duration of the symptoms.  It's very unusual for me to have a cold that lasts this long.  I did receive COVID and flu vaccines in the early Fall.My wife (also a patient of yours, Helen Rutt) is experiencing the same symptoms.  She came down with them a few days after I did.What should we do?  I hesitate to ask for an appointment for what is a mild cold, but this is a lingering mild cold.  I have not taken much in the way of over the counter cold meds, but will take whatever you recommend.  Hopefully what Helen and I have is something you are seeing in other patients and you can tell us what we should do.Thanks in advance.Best regards, Gil Ohana\n",

I’ve started noticing some irregular heartbeats and my primary suggested getting an echocardiogram, which I’ve already set up for next month. On another note, I’ve been dealing with pretty persistent abdominal pain, especially after meals—it feels like things just aren’t moving right, and I’m concerned it could be related to prior surgeries and possible scar tissue.Has there been any progress with the referral for a GI evaluation or scheduling the colonoscopy? I haven’t heard anything yet and I’m a bit anxious to get to the bottom of these stomach problems. Is there anything else I can do on my end to help speed up the process?

I do not see a referral from her and my referring eye  Dr Nguyen put one in last year.  Scheduling cannot find one.  Dr G asked for copies of results and notes.  My medical info is updated in the system for 2025. \n",

      "Hi Dr. Garay,  Did you ask me to get a new liver scan or ultra sound before seeing the new RWC liver specialist, Dr Sands, February 26th?  If so, scheduling does not see anything in the system from you or Dr Nguyen (Eye Dr. who ordered last one and referred me to the liver specialist).  I will ask Dr. Sands to send you appt. nots and ask about Hep vaccine per your request. I am scheduling colonoscopy and gynecology appts. today.   Dr. Guardino wants fasting labs from me before next visit in April.  He added back an old medication I was on, Benecar.  He will restart Zocor statin if liver specialist approves.  If not, Dr G will pick another medication to lower my cholesterol.  My BP with him was 128/87.  He said my pulse was a bit high (98) but may have been nerves.  He will monitor.  Wants me to drop some weight and said my EKG and Heart Scan looked fine. Holding 1.5 potassium tabs until next labs.Bone density scan is Jan 16th in RWC.\n",

She is advised to discuss these results with her hepatologist and discuss hepatitis vaccinations as she has no immunity on recent lab for either hep A or hep B.

I’m a transmasculine person who had top surgery a couple years ago, but the surgeon left some breast tissue (on purpose, for symmetry reasons). Recently, I noticed a bit of thickening in the left side and some tenderness, and since my mom had breast cancer, I’m getting a bit anxious. When I asked my doctor about getting an ultrasound or mammogram, the imaging center said they couldn’t do it because I’ve had top surgery, which seems odd to me, since there’s still tissue there. Shouldn’t I still be getting screened? Are there guidelines for people like me, or am I just stuck worrying in between appointments? Any advice would be appreciated.\n",

      "Hi SanjanaSorry to hear you had a panic attack on Friday. Let me know what the liver team says.In the meantime, see below for some general relaxation techniques. Chamomile tea is a great idea too.Take care,Dr D Thakor, MDStanford Primary CareRelaxation techniquesDo relaxation exercises for 10 to 20 minutes a day. You can play soothing, relaxing music while you do them, if you wish.Tell others in your house that you are going to do your relaxation exercises. Ask them not to disturb you.Find a comfortable place, away from all distractions and noise.Lie down on your back, or sit with your back straight.Focus on your breathing. Make it slow and steady.Breathe in through your nose. Breathe out through either your nose or mouth.Breathe deeply, filling up the area between your navel and your rib cage. Breathe so that your belly goes up and down.Do not hold your breath.Breathe like this for 5 to 10 minutes. Notice the feeling of calmness throughout your whole body.As you continue to breathe slowly and deeply, relax by doing the following for another 5 to 10 minutes:Tighten and relax each muscle group in your body. You can begin at your toes and work your way up to your head.Imagine your muscle groups relaxing and becoming heavy.Empty your mind of all thoughts.Let yourself relax more and more deeply.Become aware of the state of calmness that surrounds you.When your relaxation time is over, you can bring yourself back to alertness by moving your fingers and toes and then your hands and feet and then stretching and moving your entire body. Sometimes people fall asleep during relaxation, but they usually wake up shortly afterward.Always give yourself time to return to full alertness before you drive a car or do anything that might cause an accident if you are not fully alert. Never play a relaxation tape while driving a car.\n",

I’ve been having these occasional episodes where I zone out, lose awareness for a minute, and sometimes get tingling in my left hand, and it’s impacting my ability to drive and work.Can someone please check on the referral for me and let me know if there’s anything else I need to do to get this sent?

I spoke to Dr. Nahabet's office, and they said this: \"the referral just needs to state that you're being referred to Dr. Edward Nahabet for top surgery (or however the doctor wishes to word that).\"I hope this info is helpful to you.Happiest holidays to you from me and my mom. Thank you for all your tireless support in my health.\n",

I wanted to reach out because I’ve been experiencing ongoing fatigue and concentration issues as I transition back into my workload. My energy levels still aren’t quite where they need to be, and I’m finding it difficult to keep up with my typical patient schedule. I spoke with HR and they’d like documentation that outlines a gradual return-to-work plan with specific numbers. Would it be possible for you to provide a note that states I should start by seeing about 9 patients a day for the two weeks after Thanksgiving (11/25–12/6), then move up to 13 patients daily for the next two weeks (12/9–12/20), and then aim for my normal 15–16 patients each day after that?

Sometimes it can take a while to get a consultation for colonoscopy.  Alternatively, if you would like, we could place a new referral; however, there is no guarantee to be seen sooner if you go to a different location.I would recommend keeping your appointment as planned.  After consultation in April, hopefully they can get you in for the procedure in a timely manner.Best,Timothy Ulleseit, PA-CAssisting Dr. Tamparon\n",

I will be here in San Ramon until the end of the year recovering from a knee replacement surgery.  Thanks. Christina Curie\n",

I didn’t notice any other issue or hot flashes or anything. It seems the 0.025 mg/day works well and I’d prefer not to take a higher dose. Does that make sense to you?

Prefer someone near Campbell/Los Gatos/San Jose/Good Samaritan if possible. Thanks!Many \n",

      "Hi Ananta,Thank you for reaching out. Given your ongoing fatigue, it would be a good idea to check for potential causes such as anemia or thyroid issues. I recommend scheduling an appointment so we can discuss this further and order the appropriate lab tests. We could start with these labs and other routine labs (screening for hep B and C and repeat comprehensive metabolic panel since your liver enzymes were out of range 6/2024) but you may need other tests depending on what we discuss during the visit. If you are ok with getting labs drawn twice then you may go ahead and get these tests prior to your appointment. Your chart is flagging that you are due for the following health maintenance items. We can discuss more about the pap smear and mammogram during your upcoming visit. Looking forward to seeing you soon.Health Maintenance Due Topic Date Due  HEPATITIS C SCREENING  Never done  Hepatitis B Screening Discussion  Never done  PAP SMEAR  Never done  MAMMOGRAM  Never done Best regards,Alice A.

I live in Marin, so driving down twice in two days is a bit of a trek for me. Is there any possibility Dr. Sattler might have a slot Tuesday morning, maybe around the same time as my neurology visit, so I can take care of both in one trip? It’d really help, especially since I’ve been dealing with more frequent muscle tightness lately and I’d like to discuss that too. Thanks so much!\n",

      "Hi Ms. Jahrena,My name is Jenny Quan, a physician assistant helping to cover messages today. Thank you for reaching out. You're right, we don't see documentation of MMR vaccine. We can obtain labs for antibody titers to see if she's immune. Because she's on Actemra, I would not immediately recommend updating the MMR vaccine as it is a live vaccine. As far as the TB test, we can either do a skin test for which she'd have to return to the office within 48 to 72 hours to read the interpretation, or a blood test which may take about a week to return. You can make an appointment for a TB skin test at our clinic. Please answer the routine TB screening questions:TB Screening QuestionnaireWhy do you need the test?Currently any symptoms of cough, coughing up blood, fever, weight loss, tiredness, night sweats: Yes/NoHave you ever had a positive TB skin test or TB blood test?Have you ever taken medication for TB?What country were you born in?What countries have you lived in?Have you had the BCG vaccine?Have you been in contact with someone who has TB?Do you have any disease that affect your immune system (ie. Cancer, leukemia, HIV, etc.)?Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.Kindest regards,Jenny Quan, PA-CFamily Medicine San Pablo and PinolePlease note that MyHealth messages are meant for non-urgent concerns that can be answered by a simple email response.

      "2025-06-27 18:13:56,766 - query_message: Hi Dr. Lee,I wanted to touch base before I move forward with my breast cancer treatment plan. As you know, I have a history of occasional irregular heartbeats, which were checked out a couple years ago with a Holter monitor. The results then didn’t show anything concerning, just a few harmless extra beats, but I’m a little anxious about how the upcoming therapies might affect my heart. I’m scheduled to start letrozole soon, and my oncologist also mentioned IV bisphosphonates for my bone health. There’s a possibility I might need chemo too, depending on how things go.Given my background (I’m already on levothyroxine for my thyroid, take atorvastatin, and use amlodipine for mild hypertension), should I have any blood work or cardiac tests done before I begin? I want to make sure we catch any potential issues early, especially since I know some of these medications can have cardiovascular side effects. Is there anything you’d recommend as far as baseline tests or follow-up while I’m on treatment? Thanks so much for your advice and for always helping me keep everything coordinated.Take care,  Sarah\n",

      "Dr. Braunschweig,My surgery went well but I am having some post surgery issues and ended up back at Stanford this week.Multiple tests were run to see if I had cervical issues, clots or heart issues.I think that my muscles have already split again and my BP and heart rate are all over the place.I have reached out to both Dr. Khush and Dr.Bruckman on those issues. I assume that you can see the more detailed comments I sent to them . The most important is my note to Dr. Khush.I believe that Dr. Ratliff’s team also reached out to you on some blood test issues.My biggest concern is my bp and heart rate. Not sure how much those readings are influenced by my anxiety. We probably need to discuss if I need something for that.Randy \n",

I don't have any major symptoms, just some occasional stomach cramping and bloating, but nothing alarming. Has anyone else dealt with this?

      "OK, thanks. I'm familiar with the false positive rate for Cologuard. I'm in no better position than previously mentioned regarding social support, re, ride home from a colonoscopy (which is why I opted for Cologuard originally), so not much point in referring for scheduling until I have something in place. I'd do it unsedated, but my understanding is that most U.S. doctors won't.(Note: It's possible my sister in AZ would like a trip to SF, so I'll broach that with her during the Christmas holidays.)\n",

      "I have one last question. I do intermittent fasting so I never eat before noon and whenever I get blood drawn it is typically around 11:30am so I have not eaten. Therefore, most of or all of my blood work is done while fasting. Just wondering if the fasting could lower my WBC? Could we do a WBC blood test in the afternoon after I've eaten before doing all the other tests? OR do you think it is best to have all tests done?Thank you.Teri\n",

      "2025-06-27 18:14:11,382 - query_message: Hi there, I’ve been dealing with rheumatoid arthritis for a couple of years now, and while my joint pain is getting more manageable, I’ve noticed that the less active lifestyle has led me to put on quite a bit of weight. Now that my flare-ups are less frequent and I can do a little more physical activity, I really want to tackle my weight, but it’s been hard to make progress on my own. I’ve heard about some injectable medications for weight loss, and I’m curious if they might be an option for me considering my RA and the meds I’m already on. Could you tell me a bit about how the process works and what I’d need to do to get started? Thank you so much!\n",

      "Hi Evelyne,Thank you for your response. It looks like Dr. Thornton did send in a prescription for Zepbound initially and currently it looks like this medication has been denied by insurance as it is a plan exclusion. Mounjaro and Zepbound are the same medication (tirzepatide) - but different brand names.Lilly Direct Pharmacy is an option for patients to self-pay if their insurance doesn't cover. It is usually at a discounted price of $399 for a 1-month prescription of 2.5 mg (starting dose) or $549 for 5 mg.Would you like us to proceed with sending the prescription to Lilly Direct?

      "Good afternoon Caitlin,My name is Lillian, Medical Assistant to Dr. Bennitt, Eliza Gaenger. I just left you a voicemail, but I will relay the message here in this myHealth message as well.

      "2025-06-27 18:14:16,001 - query_message: Hi there, I’m hoping to get some advice for my mom, who’s currently staying at Eden hospital after a rough couple of weeks. She was admitted with a large liver cyst that ended up bleeding, and things got complicated with a bile duct blockage and a pretty serious E. coli infection. Now to top it off, she’s been having some irregular heart rhythms the doctors called atrial flutter. It’s been a lot to process.We’re a Mandarin-speaking family, and while my mom understands some English, she feels much more comfortable discussing her health in her native language. She’s a retired chemistry professor and likes to have everything explained in detail—it helps her feel less anxious and more involved. I’d be super grateful for any recommendations for either a Mandarin or Cantonese-speaking doctor (male or female) who’s thorough, patient, and used to complex cases like this. My mom will likely need some time in a skilled nursing facility before she’s strong enough to come home, and I’ll be organizing follow-ups and post-hospital care for her.If anyone has personal experience with compassionate, detail-oriented providers in the area, please let me know! I appreciate any help as we try to get my mom back on her feet. Thank you so much!\n",

I realized that ever since my job got a lot busier, I haven’t been doing my Pilates classes, which used to really help with my core and pelvic strength. Could that break from exercise be related to these symptoms? I’ve heard that pelvic floor issues can sometimes mimic urinary tract problems, but I’m not sure if that applies in my situation.

      "Hi Dr Shah,I am feeling so much better today! Thank you!Also my husband reminded that in terms of change in exercise, I stopped doing yoga ever since we moved a year ago but previously I would do that 2-3 times per week, with a lot of focus on core and pelvic floor strengthening - perhaps that is a cause and it’ll be something I’ll try to add back into my routine.  I was reading a weak pelvic floor can manifest in similar sensations as a UTI (pressure, sense of urgency, burning).Also I have my ultrasound Friday.Thanks so much,Stephanie \n",

      "Provider Response by BVD FAMILY MED MYHEALTH POOL:\n",
      "Great to hear, Stephanie.Let's see if you can restart those exercises which perhaps can help minimize your symptoms over time. Again, we should consider pelvic floor physical therapy which may be quite valuable to you.Keep me posted.Best, Dr. Shah\n",

At the time, there was some talk about maybe seeing an ENT to get a better look at my esophagus, but I haven’t heard anything since getting the test results. I’m starting to feel a bit anxious, because the soreness and tightness in my throat have actually gotten a bit worse, and occasionally I feel like food is getting stuck.I know surgery is sometimes mentioned as an option, but honestly, that feels like a big step—I’m really hoping there might be other things we could try first. Is it possible to check my records and see if another appointment should be scheduled, or if there’s any advice on next steps? I’m just hoping to figure out what’s causing all this discomfort and if there’s any way to manage it better.Thank you so much for your help!Best,  Kathy Sullivan\n",

      "Hello, Daljit-It was a pleasure to meet you and your husband this afternoon.  The chest x-ray showed similar to possibly increased multifocal reticulonodular opacities which may be a sign of pneumonia which the antibiotics will help, but may also be a sign of progression of your lung fibrosis which is related to your rheumatoid arthritis.  Please take both antibiotics and send a MyHealth message early next week to let me know how your cough is doing and how you are feeling after a few days of antibiotics.  I sent a note to Dr. Katsumoto as we discussed.  For now please HOLD the plaquenil while taking your antibiotics and continue to take the mycophenolate.All the best,Jo-Anne Landry Suffoletto, MD, MScStanford Internal MedicineReminder: Care When You Need ItFor urgent issues, call 650-498-9000, 24 hours/day for assistance.

My recent blood tests showed an elevated white blood cell count, but I was actually battling a sinus infection at the time—could that have thrown off those results? Also, my vitamin D levels are still on the low side, despite using a multivitamin that contains 2000 IU daily for the past six months. Since my last bone density scan wasn’t great, I’m a bit worried about my bone health and want to make sure I’m doing enough. I’m considering switching to a vitamin D spray to see if that absorbs better. On top of that, I’ve been eating more Greek yogurt and eggs lately to get extra protein since my doctor said I need to build some muscle, but now my cholesterol has gone up a little. Do you think my diet could be impacting my cholesterol this quickly, or should I be concerned about something else? Thanks!\n",

Sarah Strategies for Lowering Cholesterol LevelsFollow a food plan based on a calorie level to either maintain weight if you are at your goal, or to lose 1-2 pounds/week by eating 500 calories/day less than required for maintenance. Decrease your total fat intake to 20-25% of total calories. This would translate into 40-50 grams/day of total fat; Focus on monounsaturated fats such as olive/canola oil, almonds, avocado, natural almond or peanut butter and omega-3 sources including fish and flaxseed.Limit your saturated fat (from animal products and processed foods containing hydrogenated oils) to <7% of total calories, or 14 grams/day. Eliminate or limit red meat to 1-2 x week, eat only white breast meat chicken/turkey without the skin, limit egg yolks to 1-2/week; only non-fat dairy products and limit cheese to low-fat types and only 1-2 x weekIncrease your intake of fiber to 35-45 grams/day and focus on soluble fiber sources (to help lower cholesterol) such as oat bran and whole oats, cooked dried beans, peas and lentils, fresh fruits and veggies. Add 2 Tbsp. ground flax seed into your diet. This is a good source of lignins and omega-3 fatty acids--both of which help to lower LDL and raise HDL. Increase your fresh fruit and vegetable intake to 7-9 servings /day Drink at least 64 oz. water/day. Exercise: 6 times/week to include 45-60 minutes of aerobic exercise (running, biking, elliptical, treadmill) and 20-30 minutes of weight training 2-3 times/week, along with core strengthening/stretching. Track your daily food and exercise in a log or journal; or go online and use a free nutrition tracking service such as Dailyplate.com or Nutrition.com. \n",

      "Perfect timing. The results are in. They show that your thyroid is a little over active that we've swung you in the other direction. I suggest you reduce your dose to 112 mcg every day 6 days per week, but 1/2 tab (56 mcg) one day per week.

      "Hi Dr. Ratti,Happy New Year! I hope this note finds you well.My zolpidem is up for renewal on January 6th.My prescription plan has been changed and I now will be getting my prescriptions at Walgreen's on First Street.I went to give them new medicare card information and requested that they get my prescription information from CVS along with notifying you of my prescription refill request.We left for a week and was told before I left that they would follow through and contact both your office and CVS.When I went in today just to check on my medication, I was told nothing was recorded on my new client sheet and I was to contact you to fill the request and let them know.So please send the request to Walgreen's on 1st Street. I will be gone for a few days and will return on Tuesday. Please let me know if you are able to fill my request. Sincerely,NANCY CARTER\n",

I noticed that my bilirubin level is higher than the normal range again, and my CRP has climbed even more since the last time we checked it in June. I know CRP can be linked to a lot of things, but it’s making me a bit anxious because I’ve also been feeling more fatigued than usual lately and have had some mild abdominal discomfort on and off.Could you help me understand what might be causing the raised bilirubin in my situation? Is there any connection between these two markers, or things I should be looking out for given my symptoms? Also, is it worth retesting the CRP in another month, or should I be considering any further tests now? Thanks so much for your input. Best,  Alex\n",

I don’t have a fever, but the pressure in my face is really uncomfortable.I’m supposed to fly out for a work trip on Tuesday morning, and I’m a bit anxious because I also have a minor surgery scheduled next week. I wanted to check if this could be a sinus infection and if antibiotics might help at this point, or if there’s anything else you recommend.

The hospital doesn't usually keep patients with this in the hospital for longer than a week-ish, so they may discharge you with oral antibiotics after you finish the IV antibiotics and they feel like you are stable enough to leave.

      "2025-06-27 18:14:33,785 - query_message: Hi Dr. Pinyavat,I just started taking escitalopram for my anxiety, and after reading through the information sheet, I admit I’m a bit nervous about the possible side effects. I know they don’t happen to everyone, but I’ve had bad reactions to medications in the past, so I’m extra cautious. Also, I usually have a glass of wine with dinner a couple times a week, and I’m not sure if that’s safe while I’m on this medication. Is it something I should avoid entirely, or is it okay in moderation?If I start experiencing things like headaches or trouble sleeping, are those reasons to stop the escitalopram right away? Are there other medication options that might be gentler or have fewer risks? I’d really appreciate your advice because I want to feel better but avoid unnecessary problems.Thank you so much,Lisa\n",

      "I think the most important thing is to get started on the SSRI. I have confidence that it is really going to help the anxiety, not make it worse - but, you will probably not notice any meaningful improvement for a few weeks. In the interim if you feel the anxiety is severe, it's ok to take an extra ativan but try to use this sparingly.Best,Eliza Bennitt\n",

I stopped by LabCorp earlier today, but they said there weren't any labs ordered under my name yet. My next appointment with my doctor is on the 13th, and I’m wondering if I should try to get the blood work done before then, or if it’s okay to just have it done at the office during my visit. Also, I’ve been feeling a bit more tired and thirsty than usual—should I mention that too when I come in? Thanks so much for your help!\n",

      "Hi Dr. Huie,This past Friday I was beginning to have symptoms of a scratchy throat and cough. Then by Saturday mid-day I was hit out of know where with body aches, fever, chills, headache, fatigue, weakness, and lower back pain. As well as the cough that has more mucus with it. To ease the symptoms I have been taking ibuprofen. I’ve never felt this sick before except 10 years ago when I was in the hospital for plural effusion. Considering all of this, should I be seen in the office?  Thank you,Kelly White \n",

      "Hi Dr. Angelo, For the past month I’ve been having pain in my lower abdomen and pelvic area. It doesn’t feel muscular in my back, rather something internal. I get woken up by the pain every night around 4am and toss and turn until it’s time to get up. It continues to hurt about 1 hour after I’m up but after that I go about my day as normal. I can walk up stairs, lift my legs, bend over and I have no pain. I’m wondering if it could be the endometrial polyp or something else? I didn’t have the polyp removed because originally, I was told it would be done in an exam room but then I was told it would be under GA and I didn’t want to proceed at that time. I also wasn’t having pain, just a very heavy flow, which continues.  Any advice you can provide in who I should follow up would be great. Happy to see you as well, if needed. Thank you, Gina \n",

I do this every year, but I still keep getting reminders to schedule my eye exam, and it makes me worry something's missing in my record. I’ve also noticed a bit more dryness and occasional blurriness in my eyes lately and was wondering if that’s something I should mention or if it’s related to my diabetes. Could you please confirm if you’ve received the latest exam notes? Also, should I bring up these new symptoms at my next appointment? Thanks so much!\n",

The pharmacy here didn’t have the extended-release version I usually take, so they offered me the regular 10mg tablets instead. I’m a bit unsure how best to adjust the dosing with the immediate-release kind—should I just split up the doses throughout the day until I can get back to my regular meds when I return to the US next week?Also, I had a bit of a scare today with feeling faint and out of breath, so I stopped by a local clinic. The doctor there suggested I try a medicine called amiodarone as an alternative, but I’m not familiar with it and am concerned about side effects or risks since it’s different from what I’m used to. Would you suggest sticking with the regular propranolol for now, or is it okay to make the switch temporarily?Thanks so much for your help—I’m feeling a bit lost being abroad with this situation.\n",

I recently tried scheduling a check-up with the geriatric clinic at Stanford, but the soonest slot they offered isn't until next summer. I’m really concerned about waiting that long because lately, I’ve been having a lot more trouble with my memory, plus some dizziness and fatigue that seem to be getting worse. It’s starting to affect my day-to-day, especially with travel plans we’ve been looking forward to for ages. My daughter bought us tickets to visit her in Sweden for June, and then we were planning on spending a few months in Mexico with friends over the holidays. I feel conflicted—my health is obviously really important, but I also don’t want to put my life on hold when appointments seem so hard to get. Should I try to reschedule our trips just in case something serious is going on, or is there maybe another specialist locally who might be able to see me sooner? I’d really appreciate any advice or suggestions.\n",

      "Hi Aya,Thank you for sharing this important information about your family history. Given the familial risk factors you've mentioned, it is reasonable to consider some of these tests. Dr. Narula, who was covering for me last week had helped us place some blood work already. There is a cbc, cmp, thryoid, lipid panel, A1c, and stool test. These would be most appropriate for us for screening purposes. Other preventative measures to consideris a tetanus vaccine, pap smear, mammogram, covid and flu vaccines. We can discuss this further during your appointment on January 29 to determine the most appropriate tests and any additional evaluations that may be necessary.Looking forward to seeing you soon.Best,Dr. TsaiTimothy Tsai, DO, MMCiStanford Primary Care Santa ClaraP: 408.688.9720F: 408.688.9730\n",

The soreness in my arm has gotten a bit better, but I’m also noticing some mild fatigue and a lingering dull headache—not sure if that's related. Is it normal for these reactions to stick around for almost a week? Should I be doing anything special, or is there a point when you’d recommend having it looked at? Thanks so much for your help!\n",

Injection site reactions like arm soreness are not uncommon, but they usually resolve on their own fairly quickly.

I'm a bit worried because I was hoping to start my new treatment soon, and my symptoms have been getting worse lately (lots of fatigue and trouble managing my blood sugar). Has anyone else dealt with their script being rejected for similar reasons? Should I call my doctor's office directly or wait for them to fix it? I’m just anxious about the delay since my current meds aren’t working well. Any advice?\n",

This really suprised as I'm wearing every day / night strips to enable me to breathe properly.This is a medical needed surgery, can you help  expedite this? What do you suggest I do at this point?

Do you think this could be connected to the medication? Also, should I be worried about any long-term effects from having low TSH, or is it something we just keep an eye on?

My blood pressure’s been all over the place—once it shot up to 190/98, and this weekend it was still high at 145/95 even after I’d rested. I’ve tried talking to the ER doctors a few times, but they just keep telling me to follow up with my usual provider, and I’m starting to feel helpless since the pain just won’t let up and I’m worried about my heart. I’m also noticing I get a bit dizzy when I stand and sometimes have trouble focusing. Do you think my meds might not be strong enough anymore, or could this be something more serious? I just want to know what to do next.\n",

Dehydration can also contribute to these symptoms, so increasing your water intake is a good idea.However, given that these episodes are becoming more frequent and are quite bothersome, I recommend scheduling an appointment so we can evaluate this further. We may need to check your blood pressure and heart rate in different positions (lying down, sitting, and standing) and possibly run some additional tests to get to the bottom of this.Please use the Stanford MyHealth app to schedule an appointment at your earliest convenience.Take care,Christian Eloy Martinez, PA\n",

Dehydration can also contribute to these symptoms, so increasing your water intake is a good idea.However, given that these episodes are becoming more frequent and are quite bothersome, I recommend scheduling an appointment so we can evaluate this further. We may need to check your blood pressure and heart rate in different positions (lying down, sitting, and standing) and possibly run some additional tests to get to the bottom of this.Please use the Stanford MyHealth app to schedule an appointment at your earliest convenience.Take care,Christian Eloy Martinez, PA\n",

As you know, I had back surgery with Dr. Tseng on July 30. I really didn’t work at all. Still have shooting nerve pain going down my left leg, especially at rest, and always in bed. There is no good position to sleep so I find myself sleeping on my stomach which probably isn’t good for my heart. Just started PT, since he didn’t want me doing any exercises for 3 months. Anyway, I have a headache all day for over a month now. I take Tylenol before I go to bed, and as soon as I awaken. Last week I had a migraine for days. There must be something else you can prescribe. I take a Valium and occasional Lunesta, but still can’t get to sleep. I will try working out more, but also my right knee swells up when I get on my bike. I’m a mess !!!Any ideas for my headaches? I’m take 2 81 mg aspirin daily. Sorry to ramble. ThxMac \n",

For vitamin D, a common dosage is 1000-2000 IU daily.If you have any further questions or need to discuss this in more detail, feel free to schedule an appointment through the Stanford MyHealth app.Best regards,Linh Thi Thuy Dang, MD\n",

      "Hi Dr. Chern,I’m thinking you recommended D2 because I’m a vegetarian but I’ve read that D3 absorbs better, should I take D3 instead? Past few weeks my eyes have been feeling different, a tiny bit better now, but it’s like sometimes I’m feeling sensitivity to light and that’s throwing me off. is that something that happens with low iron or low vitamin D or could that be caused by the high dosage of Vitamin D that I’m taking?Or due to the occasional headaches? Also working on trying to get better sleep with the occasional children wake ups, could lack of sleep cause this?Can you also extend my work from home days which ends Dec 6 for up to two additional months and then we can re-evaluate towards that time again depending on how I’m feeling so that I don’t have to keep bothering you.Thanks again,Punam\n",

Or should I wait for the other tests to come in that you requested additional labs for?Should I pick up iron pills and start taking 1? Or wait for lab results?Also are you able to write me a doctors note. I’ve taken time off since Wednesday and maybe a few days next week as well.Thanks,Punam\n",

The last date I took the amlodipine 10 mg was 11/20, and since then I've taken my BP right after I wake up and then again in the afternoon or evening. In the two weeks my BP is typically ~135/88. A few times the systolic was above 140 (but not above 145), and would typically be under that threshold when I took it again a minute later.

      "2025-06-27 18:15:13,348 - query_message: Hey Dr. Li,I wanted to give you an update since we last spoke about my blood pressure medication. After finishing my last dose of amlodipine (10 mg) about two weeks ago, I’ve been checking my BP every morning and evening just to track where I’m at without any meds. Most days, my readings have floated around 132/85, though there have been a couple of times where the top number crept slightly over 140—never past 145 though, and usually it came back down when I rechecked it after resting a bit. I’ve noticed that the bottom number is often a bit high—sometimes between 90 and 92—but again, it tends to settle down if I relax for a few minutes.I haven’t had any headaches or dizziness, but I do sometimes feel more tense or anxious lately, which might be affecting my numbers. I remember you mentioned possibly starting Micardis if my BP didn’t stay within range off medication, but I’m wondering if these occasional spikes mean I should go ahead and start, or if it’s safe to wait a little longer and keep monitoring for now.What do you think—is it better to be cautious and begin the new prescription, or would you suggest tracking things a bit longer first? I’m trying to avoid unnecessary meds, but also don’t want to risk long-term problems. Thank you!\n",

It sounds like your blood pressures are at the borderline level between lifestyle modification or medication.

I have Medicare Part A and B, but my plan is through a Medicare Advantage provider (UnitedHealthcare), and I'm hoping to get some advice about whether that will be accepted if I need ongoing treatment. My main concern is that I’ve been having persistent muscle weakness and fatigue, and my primary doctor thinks I might need to see a neurologist at Stanford for more testing. Would you happen to know if all the neurologists at Stanford accept Medicare Advantage plans, or does it depend on the doctor? I read somewhere that most plans are accepted, but I just want to make sure before I go through the process of getting a referral and possibly running into unexpected costs. Thanks in advance!\n",

Since it’s been nearly a year since my last set of labs, I’d really like to get a good look at everything again, especially since I’ve noticed a bit more fatigue and muscle cramps lately (not sure if it’s stress or something else, but I want to stay on top of things). I’m also still taking Mounjaro, and am curious how my A1c and other markers are holding up—would it make sense to discuss adjusting the dosage at my next appointment depending on my results? Would you be able to put in orders for the labs ahead of my visit so I can get them all done at once? In addition to the A1c, I was thinking it could be helpful to check things like my Vit D, magnesium, ferritin, testosterone, creatinine, ApoB, basic metabolic panel, lipid panel, hs-CRP, SHBG, and a CBC—if you think anything else would be useful, please let me know! I realize my insurance might not cover all of these, but I’m fine to pick up the tab myself for the ones that aren’t.Thanks so much for your help, and looking forward to catching up at my appointment!  Best,  Roger\n",

      "Hi MamataI am sorry I’m not sure you’re following up. My question was I had a chest x-ray done when I had the accident in South Carolina? They found a nodule in my left mid lung. We then came back home from South Carolina. Had a chest x-ray done on October 18 at Stanford results from that chest x-ray requested to see the original chest x-ray that was taken on October 11 .The radiologist had requested to see the original x-ray from October 11, which was finally uploaded into my chart last week. I am now wanting that radiologist to review the two x-rays side-by-side to determine if a CT scan is needed. This is what Dr. Kwong had requested if you could please go back and review those notes I would appreciate it .This has nothing to do with my hand x-rays and Dr. Richards Dr. Richards is the orthopedist not a radiologist or chest x-ray specialist .I hope this makes sense .

I called our Radiology department this morning to put in a request for the Radiologist to compare your recent chest x-ray at Stanford to the one that you completed in South Carolina. Please give the Radiologist a week or so to complete the request / update your report. If you do not hear from us / see your report updated within the next week, please reach out to our office so that we may follow-up with the Radiology department.Take care,Melissa Song, DNP, FNP-BC\n",

      "This is Mamata Patel, FNP, from Donna Kwong, MD's office, responding on their behalf. Hello Kristin,I was able to review your recent right fingers x-ray from 10/29/24 which suggest your fracture alignment has improved and no other significant findings besides mild degenerative changes (arthritis) which is common finding at your age. I also see there is another x-ray order from Dr. Richards which was placed today. In terms for your CT scan question, it is appropriate to wait for your today's x-ray results to determine need for further imagines. You can also discuss this with Dr. Richards since he is your orthopedic doctor and you have an upcoming appointment with him. Let us know if you have any additional questions or concerns.Regards,SMP Pleasanton Clinical Care TeamOffice # 925-534-6500Please note that MyHealth messages are meant for non-urgent concerns that can quickly be answered with a simple email message.

      "2025-06-27 18:15:28,403 - query_message: Hello Dr. Tsai,I hope you don’t mind me reaching out. I’ve been dealing with pretty severe joint pain and swelling—mainly in my right knee and sometimes in my wrists—that my current doctor suspects could be early-stage inflammatory arthritis, possibly palindromic rheumatism. There was also talk of crystal arthritis or something related, since I had a bout of what they called “pseudo-gout” last fall. So far, all my blood tests have been negative for rheumatoid factor and such, which I gather makes things complicated.I’m moving to Palo Alto next week and really want to continue treatment without interruption, since the flares have made it hard to get around, and painkillers alone barely take the edge off. My current rheumatologist at Mass General suggested I follow up with a specialist at Stanford, but it’s been tough to navigate the referral process—especially on a tight timeline. She’s sent over my records, but apparently, Stanford needs a particular form filled out, and I’m worried my appointment will get held up for weeks.Do you have any advice on how to speed things up, or could you help me connect with someone at Stanford’s Rheumatology Department? I’m hoping to avoid another flare-up without care. Thanks so much for any guidance.Best,Sam Carter\n",

      "2025-06-27 18:15:32,438 - query_message: Sure! Here’s a new, unique question inspired by the original, with different wording, added context, and a conversational tone:Hi there,  I was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation a couple of weeks ago, and honestly, it’s been overwhelming trying to navigate it on top of some family chaos. I’m staying with my brother to support my aging mom after she had a bad fall, but it’s stressful—especially with my teenage son acting out lately, which really keeps my nerves on edge.I notice my heart tends to race when things get tense at home, even if it’s just for a few minutes. It doesn’t get as fast as when I ended up in the ER (which was terrifying), but it still scares me. The doctor in the hospital mentioned Atarax as an option for anxiety, but I’m hesitant because I heard it might affect heart rate, which I obviously don’t want.Are there any other safe ways or medications to help manage the anxiety and stress that won’t make my heart rhythm worse? I’d also love to hear about non-medication options that might help since I’m trying to avoid taking more prescriptions if possible. Thanks so much for your input—I really appreciate it.\n",

Given your new diagnosis of A-fib, it's important to avoid medications that can increase your heart rate. Atarax (hydroxyzine) can indeed have this effect, so it's good that you're cautious about using it.For managing anxiety and stress without affecting your heart rate, there are several options we can consider. Non-medication strategies such as deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, and relaxation techniques can be very effective. Additionally, certain medications like beta-blockers can help manage both anxiety and heart rate, but these would need to be prescribed and monitored carefully.I recommend scheduling an appointment so we can discuss your symptoms and medical history in more detail and find the best solution for you.

      "Hi PA Pontell -Since my physical on 9/5, I have had multiple depressive episodes and instances of severe stress/anxiety that have impeded my ability to function. With how I'm interacting with my job, I have not been able to be consistent with non-medication interventions to improve my mental/emotional state, and I honestly don't know if those types of interventions will be enough to get me to a place where I'm functioning to a satisfactory degree. It feels like a miracle that I'm getting anything done at all right now, and my life is definitely on hold while put nearly all of my available energy into making sure my performance at work doesn't suffer too much.tl;dr - I want to discuss possible changes to my antianxiety/antidepressant medications. And I also might want to look at how well I'm sleeping, since it's been 5 years since my last sleep study (dx'ed with mild sleep apnea) and I've gained at least 10 lbs since then (which was the main risk factor they identified).\n",

      "Hi Scott,I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing increased depressive episodes and anxiety. It sounds like it's been quite challenging for you. Let's definitely discuss potential changes to your medications and explore options that might better support you.Regarding your sleep, it would be a good idea to reassess your sleep apnea given the weight gain and the time that has passed since your last study. Please schedule an appointment through the Stanford MyHealth app so we can discuss these concerns in detail and come up with a plan that works for you.Take care, and I look forward to seeing you soon.Sarah Pontell, PA\n",

Lately, I’ve been struggling a lot with heartburn and discomfort in my chest and throat—sometimes it even wakes me up at night. I’ve been avoiding spicy and acidic foods, but it doesn’t seem to help much. I was wondering if this could be related to acid reflux or something else? Also, since my previous gastroenterologist moved away, I’m not sure who to see now. Would you be able to recommend someone for a GI consult or let me know if you have any upcoming appointments?

I take Losartan daily, and when I tried picking up my prescription at CVS, they told me there weren’t any refills left, even though I was pretty sure my doctor had sent more in a couple months ago. I double-checked online through my patient portal, and it says there should be refills, but the pharmacy keeps insisting there aren’t any and that they need to hear back from my doctor before they can give it to me.I’m starting to get a bit worried since I’ve missed a few days now, and my BP has been higher than normal—I’ve had headaches and just feel a bit “off.” Is there any way to clarify if my prescription can be refilled on your end, or is there a faster way to get this sorted out? I don’t want to go too long without my medication. Thanks for your help.\n",

      "Hi,I’m out of Amlodipine. Rite Aid insists that I have no refills available. Last week, they requested refills. At that point, MyHeath app said I was out of refills. As of Monday, MyHeath said I had refills available. I went to Rite Aid yesterday (Wednesday, Nov 6) and they said I had no refills available. Rite Aid requested more refills. Now, Rite Aid says the doctor replied that I requested a refill too soon. I am unable to get a refill. I’ve been out for probably a week or so. Do I have refills available on your end?What can I do to get this med?Thanks,Cheryl\n",

The reason I ask is because usually when I go to the lab and they do the blood draw, the test is removed from the \"ordered tests\" in MyHealth, but this time I see that other tests are removed from \"ordered tests\" and I can see the results, but that particular test is not removed and there is no results for it.

I recently went in for some blood work, including a genetic panel for thalassemia since I’ve been having ongoing fatigue and mild anemia, and because my mom is a carrier. I just checked my patient portal and got the results for everything except the alpha thalassemia test—it still shows as “pending” and I haven’t received any update about it. The other test results were posted very quickly, so I’m getting a bit anxious as I was hoping to sort out why I’ve been feeling so tired. Is it normal for the alpha thalassemia screening to take longer to process? Or is there a chance the test wasn't performed and I might need to go back for another blood draw? I’d appreciate it if you could let me know what’s going on, as I’m eager to get some answers.Thank you so much!  Sara\n",

      "2025-06-27 18:15:47,427 - query_message: Hi Dr. Karnany,Hope you’re doing well. I wanted to check in before my upcoming appointment. I had my blood work done as you requested, but I realized some of the tests might have overlapped with what my endocrinologist just ordered (they had me do some follow-up cortisol labs too). The lab staff mentioned it, but went ahead anyway—I hope that’s okay.I’ve been having some strange sensations lately, mostly in my legs—they often feel really heavy and almost rubbery, which makes it hard to walk sometimes. I notice a numbness, especially around my shins and ankles, and there’s occasional tingling in my fingers and feet now too. I even noticed my grip felt weak today and typing is more difficult than usual.On top of that, my sleep has been really disrupted; I wake up several times a night, and when I do get to sleep, my dreams are so intense and realistic that I wake up feeling almost more exhausted than when I went to bed.I’m wondering if these symptoms could be side effects from my medication or if there might be something else going on. Should I be concerned, and is there anything you recommend I do while I wait for our appointment? Thanks so much for your help.\n",

Surgery went fine.after surgery I was in pain, but it went down..Dr. My  concern is the sinus headache yesterday before surgery. I woke up with a sinus headache again and is been going on and that is the worst thing that bothered me right now. I am doing the Flonase taking the allergy medication doing the nitty pot and this time even with the strong medication they gave me for pain doesn’t go away completely. I know we talk about it that if I continue having them you was going to refer me to Specialist), can we go ahead and do it please?Thank you, Dr. See you in December. \n",

      "Following up on the previous message, as we're nearing the time when I need to renew the tirzepatide. I've noticed over the past roughly two weeks that diet has started to increase and weight loss has slowed and possibly started to reverse. It may be that my GLP-1/GIP sensitivity is decreasing, or something else, but I would expect the loading dose to only go so far.Rather than staying at 2.5mg, let's increase to 5mg starting with the next prescription. It would be additionally convenient if we could do a 90-day prescription or similar rather than the default 4 weeks as we near the new year, but we'll see what the options are.\n",

My left knee has also started aching more than usual, and it sometimes feels stiff during the day. Since I have a history of kidney stones, I’d really appreciate if we could also run a thorough set of labs like we did last year, including my Vitamin D levels (which always fluctuate for me) and a bone density scan this time, if you think it’s needed. If you recommend checking anything else related to bone or joint health, please add those as well.Could we plan to do these labs ahead of my visit so we can review the results together?

I went ahead and placed orders for your annual visit, however, it looks like you just had your vitamin D checked just in November of last year - typically we recommend checking this every year at the level that you had. As for your request about making the upcoming appointment your annual visit - it looks like your last medicare wellness visit was Feb 13, 2024. Unfortunately, even if we want to, Medicare will not provide coverage for an earlier wellness visit as it has to be a full 12 months prior to your next one. I believe this is the case for you labwork as well. Additionally, given that you already have a few things to discuss with Liz, it'll be best to keep these two appointments separate so you have ample time to discuss your symptoms and next steps.

Congrats and best wishes for a problem-free pregnancy.If you recall I had stopped Vit D around mid Oct 2024 as this aggravates kidney stone formations according to my urologist.   I have been OK up until a few weeks back when I noticed a small pain during sleep in my back close to my tail bone.  I tend to sleep on my side.   Pain is present independent of which side I sleep.  So my sleep has not been good recently.  No back pain otherwise.   I attributed this to my usual back pain issues and have been doing stretches and exercises to take care of this.   But have not seen any improvement.   Also this Sun, all of a sudden around dinner time I noticed I could not bend my right leg anymore.  My leg was perfectly fine Sun morning.  So this got me thinking if this is due to lack of Vit D supplement.  What do you think?   Should I restart my 1000IU Vit D supplement?Please advise. Ajit\n",

I am very anxious of kidney stones since this the the 3rd time I have this issue and I have already been thru one painful kidney stone surgery in 2016.   Looks like I have to go thru one more surgery for the current stone I have.  So I am doing everything I can to reduce the probability of future stone formations.  Hence stopped the Vit D supplement.The issue now is what risks or side-effects I might have by not taking this supplement.Please advise.Thx.Ajit Deora\n",

I went ahead and placed orders for your annual visit, however, it looks like you just had your vitamin D checked just in November of last year - typically we recommend checking this every year at the level that you had. As for your request about making the upcoming appointment your annual visit - it looks like your last medicare wellness visit was Feb 13, 2024. Unfortunately, even if we want to, Medicare will not provide coverage for an earlier wellness visit as it has to be a full 12 months prior to your next one. I believe this is the case for you labwork as well. Additionally, given that you already have a few things to discuss with Liz, it'll be best to keep these two appointments separate so you have ample time to discuss your symptoms and next steps.

While the 5Strands test is a popular option found online, it is not a clinically validated test for diagnosing food or environmental allergies. I would recommend more reliable and validated methods to identify any potential allergies or sensitivities.We can start with a detailed history and possibly some standard allergy tests, such as  specific IgE blood tests, which are more accurate and clinically accepted.

      "Update,No real improvement with condition, but no worsening. Still quite painful at times. Finished 6 day course of Prednisone to little or no effect. I’ve gone back and come up with a better timeline of symptoms. Had back pain and some mild sciatic symptoms, some pain in back of thigh, starting around Halloween. My walking and steps per day remained relatively consistent through about Dec. 18. On Nov.21, I fell quite hard on my right side. It stunned me, but I didn’t feel as if any bones were hurt and did not notice any bruising. On Dec. 18 I handled about 15 bags of 60# concrete mix. The next couple of days were when the pain worsened and developed at the shin above the ankle. I saw you on Dec.23. A couple of observations, the pain worsens throughout the day. The back pain comes and goes as does the hip pain, but the hip pain is most acute. I see the physiatrist this Friday. Thanks\n",

      "Hi Pat,Thank you for the detailed update. It's helpful to have a clearer timeline of your symptoms. Given the history of your fall and the heavy lifting, it's possible that these events have contributed to your current pain and symptoms.Since you are seeing the physiatrist this Friday, please make sure to share this timeline and your observations with them. It will be important for them to know about the fall and the heavy lifting, as well as the specific areas where you are experiencing pain and how it changes throughout the day.If you have any further questions or need additional support, please don't hesitate to reach out.

I usually get my prescriptions filled automatically, so I didn’t realize I was almost out until today. To make things more stressful, I’m leaving for a family reunion out of state on Friday morning and I’m worried about missing any doses since my BP has been creeping up lately.It looks like my old pharmacy (Walgreens on Main St.) deactivated the prescription for some reason. Is it possible to send a new prescription to the same pharmacy so I can pick it up before I leave? Also, I’ve had a few headaches recently—I’m not sure if that’s connected to running low on my meds, but I thought I should mention it.Thanks so much for your help.

It's good to know that your ALT levels have been consistent, and I saw this in your previous labs as well.  We will continue to monitor them.2. If your glucose levels have been stable and the recent high reading seems like an anomaly, we can recheck it in a few months to confirm.

      "Thank you, Dr. Duggal.The last remaining test is bone density and there was an improvement in the spine but the other two areas did not.  I was able to review the numbers while there.I have been diligent with the calcium, vitamin D3/K and Biosil but know that I can increase the calcium dosage, taking the second set of capsules at night.  There are other natural supplements I can add in, which I will begin right away.The good news is that there was an improvement and it’s motivating to know I can manage this and with a more diligent approach, continue to improve.   You know how resistant I am to taking drugs :)I’ll reach out to your office in 3 months to schedule the blood work for another glucose and HBAC1 test.I wish you a very happy holiday season!Kay\n",

      "Hi Dr. Duggal. Wanted to touch base with you in regard to weight loss and night sweats…and stress/BP. I am in AZ and unable to make an apt while here, so this is my best approach until I return. Had an emergency with my oldest and wont be coming home until 11/11, going to my mammogram on 11/13 and heading back to AZ. I do continue to have night sweats, some days I wake up drenched and others damp. In addition, my clothes are starting to fall off as I continue to lose weight. I stopped exercising to see if that was the root but I haven’t exercised since I last saw you. I weighed myself today and I am at 140 lbs. I cant recall what I was on my last visit but feel like I have lost a bit more weight since then. Can you please confirm? Also, I have been closely monitoring my blood pressure and although it has been a little better, I am consistently at 154/94; 153/93; 159/92;  152/97. My BP used to be low. I believe this has been a result of stress from work. Please LMK your thoughts. Thx \n",

      "Hi Kelly,I am certainly concerned about your persisting symptoms and weight loss, etc. Your last weight in my office last month was 147 lbs.  I have ordered some labs for you to have done at any Quest lab near you in Arizona.  I am glad you are going to have your mammogram done. I am also thinking you may need some additional imaging with a CT scan, etc but will need to assess you further before ordering some of these tests.You mentioned you will be back in town on Nov 11. I can most certainly see you in person or by video visit appointment on Nov 11 or 12. I cannot see you the same day as your mammogram on Nov 13 because I am out of town that day.  Let me know which day you are back in California and can see me. Please continue to monitor your BP and keep a BP log. I would also suggest maybe going to an Urgent Care in Arizona to have them assess your BP in the next couple of weeks, before you return home.I hope your daughter is doing alright. Please reach back out to me to let me know which date you prefer and I will accommodate you on that day.Take care,Eena Duggal, MDFamily Medicine and Pediatrics925/462-7060\n",

Generally I swim about 2500-3000 yards in practice 5-7 days a week. This year I have done less competition because I have been too busy at work.It looks like I may need to modify my swim program, with the results of the echo.

I am also hoping that with reduction in blood pressure (ie afterload), that will improve the gradient across the stenotic aortic valve, and thereby improve your exercise capacity.BestKevin Chang\n",

Walking long distances—like in big parking lots—has become really tough for me, more than I’d like to admit. I want to be as independent as possible, but getting around is starting to feel overwhelming on bad days. I was wondering, what steps would I need to take to be considered for a disabled parking permit? And do I need specific documentation from my doctor? Any guidance would be really appreciated.\n",

It definitely helped with mood regulation - but I also felt somewhat odd and was quicker to car sickness/nausea. Also, while it didn’t impact my libido, it did impact ability to orgasam which wasn’t ideal.Since it came as a pill rather than a capsule, and my period is due around the 27th I’ve been trying half pills since Monday and that seems to be a better compromise.

      "2025-06-27 18:16:06,198 - query_message: Hi Dr. Chen,Hope you're having a good week! I wanted to touch base about the sertraline you prescribed for my PMS symptoms last month. I started taking it just after our last appointment, and I did notice that my mood swings around my cycle weren’t as intense, which was great. However, I’ve also been feeling a bit more sensitive to motion—like, even short car rides have left me queasy lately. Plus, I haven’t really had issues with desire, but I’m finding it’s taking a lot more effort to actually climax, which is kind of frustrating.I read online that sometimes lowering the dose or splitting the pill can help with side effects, so for the past few days I’ve been taking half a pill instead of a full one and that seems to work better for me—less queasiness but still some emotional balance. Is it okay to keep doing the half dose, or should I stick to the whole one? Also, would you recommend trying another med that maybe doesn’t affect arousal as much? Would appreciate your advice on this!Thanks so much,Lena\n",

      "Hi Dr. Chen,I hope all is well. I just got back from a work trip, so I got a bit behind. With regard to the fluoxetine; I tried it right after I saw you and which was about a week before my period. It definitely helped with mood regulation - but I also felt somewhat odd and was quicker to car sickness/nausea. Also, while it didn’t impact my libido, it did impact ability to orgasam which wasn’t ideal.Since it came as a pill rather than a capsule, and my period is due around the 27th I’ve been trying half pills since Monday and that seems to be a better compromise. The side effects seem to have gone and close to the same improvement in emotional regulation. Thoughts?Thanks!-Diane\n",

      "Hello Diane,Thanks for letting me know.The lowest effective and tolerated dose is fine if it helps to offset the side effects.I just sent in the refill for the 20 mg dose so you can continue to split in half.Glad it's helping :) Have a good weekend.Kindly,Eunice S. Chen, MD\n",

      "Hi Dr. Chen,I apologize if this is the incorrect process for scheduling an annual physical appointment; for some reason I was unable to schedule via the “schedule an appointment” section in the app. If it is possible to do things this way, I was wondering if I could book a physical for any days 12/17-20 or from 1/4-10. Of course, I can call your office if that is preferred. As a separate question, I began taking Sertraline (100mg) this past Summer, and I was wondering if it would be possible to refill this prescription. I will be home next week, and can pick it up from my typical Sharon Park CVS pharmacy.Thank you for your assistance! Best,Zoe \n",

I wanted to reach out because I've recently been having some worrying symptoms that I thought you should know about. On a few occasions over the past couple of months, I’ve noticed that I get really winded even with light activity, like walking up the stairs or carrying groceries. My chest sometimes feels heavy or tight, and I’ve noticed episodes where I get unusually fatigued, to the point where I need to sit or lie down. There have also been times when I feel a bit dizzy or lightheaded, especially after a stressful day at work or when I haven’t had much sleep.I have been trying to lead a healthier lifestyle this year, including exercising regularly and cutting back on caffeine and junk food, but these symptoms seem to happen regardless. I’m starting to get a bit concerned that there might be an underlying heart issue or something else going on. Could you please recommend a specialist I could see for some further tests or a thorough checkup? I’d really appreciate your advice.Thank you so much for your help.Best regards,  Alex\n",

      "Yes, Cindy, a calcium score of zero is a good score. It indicates that there is no detectable calcified plaque in your coronary arteries, which is a positive sign for your heart health. However, it does not directly relate to your LDL levels. High LDL can be influenced by various factors, including diet, genetics, and other health conditions. It's important to continue managing your LDL levels as discussed with cholesterol med  to keep LDL < 70 because lipoprotein (a) level is elevated. I would like for you to see a cardiologist as well. If you agree, please let me know and I will send referral.Best,Dr. Hung\n",

According to the current state of knowledge, coronary calcifications are a marker for coronary atherosclerosis. The more calcium is detected, the higher is the likelihood for an obstructive coronary disease. However there is no unique relationship between the amount of detected calcium and the extent of localization of this disease. The amount of calcium is closely correlated with the extent of coronary atherosclerosis, although the true \"plaque burden\" is underestimated. There is only a low risk of a cardiac event in the next 2 to 5 years.  Reference Norms of Calcium Score No Identifiable Calcification 0 Minimal Identifiable Calcification 1-10 Mild Calcification 11-100 Moderate Calcification 101-400 Significant Calcification 401 and above   IMPRESSION: Calcium Score =0.

May I please have the Zepbound 7.5 mg Rx reactivated?  My pharmacy has now stored the 10 mg Rx.  I would like to see how I do on one more month of this dose but will need a new/reinstated Rx, please.2.  I have done one week of Flonase.  My cough and throat phlegm are still present (2 months now).  It had maybe improved by 10%?  Should I try an antihistamine on top of this?  3.  Knowing my daughters will likely bring home colds, I think it may be in my best interest to have some sort of maintenance inhaler during the cold/flu season.

Thank you for your message and updates.1. I have resent the Zepbound 7.5 mg prescription for you to your listed safeway, that should hopefully be ready for you in the next few days. Please let me know if you need further help with this. 2. Flonase takes a few weeks for the symptoms to improve, typically our ENT colleagues recommend continuing for at least 4-6 weeks to see results. One thing I'd recommend is making sure to do a nasal rinse before using the flonase to help clear the debris from your nasal passages and help with better absorption of the nasal spray. You can certainly add in an antihistamine in the mean time but it may not help your symptoms as much as the flonase will. 3. It sounds like a good idea to discuss a maintenance inhaler for the cold/flu season. Please schedule an appointment with Dr. Villalon through the Stanford MyHealth app at your convenience.

      "Dear Dr. Priti Parekh;Since seeing Dr. Dobberfuhl,Urologist , she reduced the nitrofurantoin from 100 MG to 50MG. I have been getting very much more sick. I had testing done at the walk in clinic verifying this (10/28/24) decline. Then you so graciously referred me to the non-Stanford Urologist, Dr. Sean Berquist, because Dr. Dobberfuhl could not do my cystoscope until next year. I saw Dr. Berquist yesterday. He immediately switched me back to your original prescription of  100 MG of nitrofurantoin. I can notice an improvement already!Thank you! Thank you!! Thank you!!! For sending me to Dr. Berquist! He was considerate, kind, informative, respectful,patient, & listened to me, giving good, informative answers, with integrity.Thank you!Dr. Dobberfuhl did recommend a terrific laxative for me: Miralax. It is the best that I have ever used. I appreciate that!Sincerely,                      Janet Johnson\n",

I saw a consent form in my patient portal related to my medication agreement, but I couldn’t figure out how to save or print it out. Would it be possible for your office to send a physical copy to my address? I want to make sure I get everything signed and back to you so I don’t have any interruptions with my refills. Also, I’ve noticed some increased soreness in my back and legs—do you want me to mention that in the paperwork, or should I schedule a separate appointment to discuss the new pain? Thanks so much for your help!\n",

I noticed when I went to pick up my Simvastatin for my cholesterol, the pharmacist told me there aren’t any refills left on my prescription, even though I thought I had a few more months. I’m almost out—only two tablets left. I’m a little worried because I know how important it is to keep my cholesterol under control, especially since I had that borderline high reading last checkup. Could you help me sort this out or send another prescription to the pharmacy? Also, if possible, could we do a 90-day supply this time? Thank you so much for your help!\n",

      "Dear Dr Tim,I saw Dr McDonald, Sutter Cardiology, today.  Although I am feeling better, my EKG showed no change and he suggested I have an aortic valve replacement in the next few months.  I have an appt Nov 19 with Dr Kadakia, who will order tests and make a recommendation.Another issue.  I am having more shoulder pain and you told me to call to schedule an appt with Dr Qatu.  I called Oct 4.  I was told someone would call me back.  Nothing!  I called again last week. Have not received a call back.  Called again today and was told I need a referral.  They keep saying Dr Telusca is orchestrating my medical care.  I saw her on a video call once for 10 minutes as a follow up after an RFA of Dr Rasouli, who was just filling in.  I was unimpressed with Dr Telusca and do not want her to be involved with my care ever. I wrote her a “nice” letter and she said she is transferring my chart to you.  So please make a referral to Dr Qatu.  Thank you.  Stanford’s bureaucracy disgusts me.Marcia\n",

      "2025-06-27 18:16:30,055 - Provider's response to this similar message: Good morning Nancy,Early congratulations on becoming a grandmother!There are two vaccine formulations - Td (without the pertussis) and TDaP (with the pertussis = whooping cough). TDaP should be given at least once as an adult. All the ones after that can be Td, unless one will be having close contact with newborns/infants.For healthy adults, we generally recommend getting the Td/TDaP every 10 years. If you will have close contact with infants/newborns, and your last TDaP was more than 5 years ago, then you should get it now.I see you had received the TDaP (tetanus, diphtheria, & pertussis) vaccine on 2/2/2007 and Td  vaccine on 10/22/19.Thus, because you will be having contact with a newborn soon, you should get your TDaP vaccine now. Medicare only covers TDaP at the pharmacy, not in the office, so I recommend you go to any local one to get yours (Walgreens, CVS, Safeway, Rite-Aid, Costco, etc).Best regards,Dana Lee, RNRegistered Nurse for Internal Medicine Drs.

      "Good morning Nancy,Early congratulations on becoming a grandmother!There are two vaccine formulations - Td (without the pertussis) and TDaP (with the pertussis = whooping cough). TDaP should be given at least once as an adult.

I generally try to stay on top of my vaccines, but with everything going around lately (my allergies are acting up and I’ve been feeling a bit rundown), I just want to be proactive. Are there any other immunizations I should ask about—like pneumonia or shingles—or is that only recommended for certain ages?

Pneumococcal Vaccine: The CDC recommends pneumococcal vaccine for children under 5 and adults over 50. If you've never had a pneumococcal vaccine in the past I would recommend considering it. It's generally safe to receive multiple vaccines at the same time. Given the prevalence of flu and Covid-19 at this point in time I would recommend prioritizing those vaccines.

      "Hello Dr. Baule,I will be traveling to India for the first time in November, and I was wondering what vaccinations you think I may need. I believe I need my tetanus vaccination as well since my last shot was over 10 years ago. If I schedule a standard office visit will I be able to do all necessary vaccinations on the same day? Thank you!\n",

      "Hello Cindy,Traveling to India is exciting! For your trip, you may need several vaccinations, including:1. **Tetanus**: Since your last shot was over 10 years ago, you will need a booster.2. **Hepatitis A**: Recommended for most travelers.3. **Typhoid**: Recommended for most travelers.4. **Hepatitis B**: If you haven't completed the series.5. **Japanese Encephalitis**: Depending on your travel plans and duration.6. **Rabies**: If you will be in contact with animals or in rural areas.7. **Malaria prophylaxis**: Not a vaccine, but important to discuss.You can schedule a standard office visit, and we can administer the necessary vaccinations on the same day. You can also go to a travel clinic. Best,Parveen Kaur Bhatia, NP assisting Dr. Baule, Michael Brandon\n",

      "2025-06-27 18:16:39,940 - query_message: Hi Doctor, I’m looking forward to my appointment next week and wanted to give you a heads-up about a few things I’d like to discuss:1. I’ve been struggling with really poor sleep, loud snoring, and constant fatigue during the day. I was told it might be sleep apnea and tried using a CPAP for about a month, but honestly, it was uncomfortable and didn’t make a difference for me. I’m on a long waitlist for a proper sleep study. Are there any other treatments or devices that might help while I wait? I’ve read about other gadgets like mouth guards—do any of those actually work?2. My thyroid levels have been a bit all over the place, and I’m already on medication. Are there any complementary therapies or lifestyle changes I should consider to help manage it better?3. I’ve noticed my toenails are looking more discolored, thicker, and just generally unhealthy. It’s starting to bother me, especially since I play sports barefoot. Could this be a fungal issue? Is there anything I can do at home to treat it, or should I be worried about something more serious?4. I had an episode of really painful swelling and bleeding around my rectum a couple of months ago that lasted for weeks. It hasn’t been as bad lately, but I’m worried it could come back. Could it have been hemorrhoids, or should I be checked for something else?5. I’ve had a persistent cough for months. It’s not constant but seems to flare up at night or after exercise. I haven’t noticed any wheezing, but it just won’t go away. Any ideas on what could be causing this?6. Last thing—I need to get caught up on vaccines, specifically tetanus and the flu shot, since I’ll be volunteering at my kid’s school. Can I get those done at our visit?Thanks so much, see you soon!\n",

I wanted to check in because although the pantoprazole you prescribed has helped calm down the worst of my acid reflux, I’m still having pretty frequent bloating and some mild stomach cramps after meals. It’s been going on for a couple of months now, and I’m starting to wonder if something in my diet is causing it—especially since I seem to feel worse after eating bread or dairy.  Do you think it would be worthwhile to see a specialist for some further tests, just to rule out things like celiac disease or intolerances? I’m feeling a bit lost trying to figure it all out on my own. Let me know what you think!Thanks so much,Sam\n",

      "Hi Diane,Thank you for your message. I am one of the Internal Medicine physicians covering messages in the clinic today. I hope I can help you with this.The bone loss associated with PPIs (medications such as omeprazole, esomeprazole) can occur with long term use. However, if you are having symptoms from too much acid, the benefits of the medications outweigh the risks. We'll try to use the medications for the shortest duration necessary to manage your symptoms to avoid this. I'm glad to hear you're starting the gut restoration program through Integrative Medicine, as it may help address some of your symptoms as well.Hope that helps and if you have any concerns or experience any side effects, please let us know.Take care,Doris Chen MD\n",

I’ve been feeling extra fatigued and short of breath lately, and I’m a bit worried it might be related to my ongoing iron issues. Would you be able to let me know if my latest results suggest it’s time to schedule another iron infusion? Also, since I usually need an ultrasound-guided IV, should I go ahead and book that appointment too?Thanks so much for your help!Best,  Melissa\n",

      "➡️ Message by Sender ZAMORA, ESMERALDA [ S0352882]: Hi Dr.Berube, I did a full CBC blood draw yesterday at PAMF. Do you have access to that? The nurse from my OBGYN’s office said I am anemic and should take iron supplements. I responded letting her know that I actually have an iron overload and was advised to avoid any supplements with iron. Can you confirm this is correct?I have my anatomy scan at Stanford this morning and can pop into the lab for more blood test if you prefer that. Let me know. Thanks! Brianna \n",
      "➡️ Provider's response to this specific message is: Hi Brianna, You are correct. You have been diagnosed with compensated hemolytic anemia due to hereditary xerocytosis, and your iron levels are currently being managed through regular phlebotomies. It's essential to understand the implications of your condition and the reason for not taking iron supplements.Key Takeaway:Do not take iron supplements. You are at risk for iron overload due to your hereditary xerocytosis, and adding more iron can worsen your condition. Focus on regular blood checks and maintain a healthy diet.Understanding Your Condition:Hereditary Xerocytosis: This is a rare genetic condition affecting red blood cells (RBCs) that results in increased RBC destruction (hemolysis). Your specific mutation (PIEZO1) causes changes in your blood cells leading to this condition.Iron Overload: Due to your hereditary xerocytosis, you are at risk for iron overload, especially since this condition causes increased RBC turnover. Your recent liver MRI has indicated significant iron overload.Current Treatment:You are receiving phlebotomies (scheduled blood draws to reduce excess iron) to help manage your iron levels. Since starting phlebotomies in June 2023, your ferritin (a marker of iron levels) has been gradually decreasing. Note: since you are pregnant, we have been holding phlebotomy for the remainder of your pregnancy. It's vital to continue avoiding iron supplementation during this time and keep an open line of communication with your healthcare team regarding your health and iron management.Avoiding Iron Supplements:Why Not Take Iron Supplements: Given your diagnosis of iron overload, taking iron supplements can exacerbate the problem. Your body already has excess iron due to the hemolytic anemia, and adding more iron can lead to further complications, including damage to your liver and other organs.Monitor Your Iron Levels: Since your treatment involves phlebotomy to manage iron overload, it's crucial not to introduce additional iron into your system. Always discuss any new supplements or medications with your healthcare provider.Additional Nutritional Guidance:While you need to avoid iron supplements, ensure that you are getting adequate nutrition, particularly folic acid, which is important for blood health. Folic acid can help support your body in producing healthy red blood cells.When to Seek Help:If you experience symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, or any unusual symptoms, contact your healthcare provider promptly. Regular follow-up and monitoring are critical to managing your condition effectively.If you have any additional questions, feel free to ask!Thanks, J Ryan, MSN, RNNurse Coordinator, Hematology\n",

As we had discussed in our last appointment, I consulted with a gastro (Dr Nguyen) and had a colonoscopy + endoscopy. That procedure did not find anything unusual, and while Dr Nguyen says that there are further steps we could take to investigate possible issues with my iron absorption (\"a specific type of CT scan to evaluate for possible small intestinal problems followed by a possible video capsule endoscopy to take pictures of your small intestine\"), I know that we had discussed trying an iron infusion if the colonoscopy did not find anything conclusive. I think that's the approach I would prefer since it would presumably reveal a potential bone marrow issue (if my blood counts stay low) or higher iron/blood counts don't change how I feel (in which case I don't see any reason to keep investigating unless my current levels are otherwise concerning in and of themselves).Does that seem reasonable to you?Thank you,Isaiah \n",

      "➡️ Message by Sender DIEP, ROBERT [ S0328143]: Hello,Should I be getting an Iron infusion soon while we are waiting for my bone marrow biopsy/copper? My HGB is steadily dropping again. Platelets are also dropping and I don’t know why.  Dr Muppidi stopped my Imuran 10 days ago to see if that would give some clarification. Also wanted to mention that I have a lot of fluid retention and painful cramping all over. If we do iron infusion just a reminder that I need a different kind because of the reaction I had the first time.Thank you,Jason\n",

I'm still checking in with Dr Galatin for who will take the lead, but if you are getting transplanted here , then you should have a Stanford based hematologist for potential coagulation issues --and possibly iv iron if needed.   If you are being considered at UCSF, then I recommend that you see Dr Cornett as well --or , if you would  like an independent opinion from mine, I'm happy to refer you.

      "➡️ Message by Sender ZAMORA, ESMERALDA [ S0352882]: Hi Dr.Berube, I did a full CBC blood draw yesterday at PAMF. Do you have access to that? The nurse from my OBGYN’s office said I am anemic and should take iron supplements. I responded letting her know that I actually have an iron overload and was advised to avoid any supplements with iron. Can you confirm this is correct?I have my anatomy scan at Stanford this morning and can pop into the lab for more blood test if you prefer that. Let me know. Thanks! Brianna \n",
      "➡️ Provider's response to this specific message is: Hi Brianna, You are correct. You have been diagnosed with compensated hemolytic anemia due to hereditary xerocytosis, and your iron levels are currently being managed through regular phlebotomies. It's essential to understand the implications of your condition and the reason for not taking iron supplements.Key Takeaway:Do not take iron supplements. You are at risk for iron overload due to your hereditary xerocytosis, and adding more iron can worsen your condition. Focus on regular blood checks and maintain a healthy diet.Understanding Your Condition:Hereditary Xerocytosis: This is a rare genetic condition affecting red blood cells (RBCs) that results in increased RBC destruction (hemolysis). Your specific mutation (PIEZO1) causes changes in your blood cells leading to this condition.Iron Overload: Due to your hereditary xerocytosis, you are at risk for iron overload, especially since this condition causes increased RBC turnover. Your recent liver MRI has indicated significant iron overload.Current Treatment:You are receiving phlebotomies (scheduled blood draws to reduce excess iron) to help manage your iron levels. Since starting phlebotomies in June 2023, your ferritin (a marker of iron levels) has been gradually decreasing. Note: since you are pregnant, we have been holding phlebotomy for the remainder of your pregnancy. It's vital to continue avoiding iron supplementation during this time and keep an open line of communication with your healthcare team regarding your health and iron management.Avoiding Iron Supplements:Why Not Take Iron Supplements: Given your diagnosis of iron overload, taking iron supplements can exacerbate the problem. Your body already has excess iron due to the hemolytic anemia, and adding more iron can lead to further complications, including damage to your liver and other organs.Monitor Your Iron Levels: Since your treatment involves phlebotomy to manage iron overload, it's crucial not to introduce additional iron into your system. Always discuss any new supplements or medications with your healthcare provider.Additional Nutritional Guidance:While you need to avoid iron supplements, ensure that you are getting adequate nutrition, particularly folic acid, which is important for blood health. Folic acid can help support your body in producing healthy red blood cells.When to Seek Help:If you experience symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, or any unusual symptoms, contact your healthcare provider promptly. Regular follow-up and monitoring are critical to managing your condition effectively.If you have any additional questions, feel free to ask!Thanks, J Ryan, MSN, RNNurse Coordinator, Hematology\n",

    "  - **Relevance:** Include all clinically relevant complaints or concerns discussed, including those introduced in direct messages by the patient, as symptoms/chief complaints or in new \"assessment_and_plan\" issues.\n",
    "  - **Physical Exam:** Record each PE subfield as completely as possible. If side-specific findings are present (e.g., right/left ear), include these in the most granular field appropriate.\n",

If a complaint is new (e.g., from a patient message, not the prior note), include your clinical response as an entry.\n",
    "  - **Instructions:** General instructions (e.g., when to follow up, how to schedule) should be recorded in \"general_guidelines\"; pharmacy details as specified.\n",

    "  - **Additional Notes:** Include any clinical details, context, or provider action plans not clearly fitting in the other structured fields.\n",

    "  **Strict Guidelines:**\n",

    "  - Do not summarize or condense the patient's clinical complaints or history; preserve their language and details in the output.\n",

    "I have a question about Lipid Panel with Calculated LDL ordered on 11/1/2024. For the past 2 years you have also ordered a  PSA and Metabolic panel tests and in 2022 CBC w/o diff. Are you purposely not scheduling these tests this year?Also, I don't think we've ever tested for Hemoglobin A1c. I read that should be done after age 35 or so. Is that not the case.Lastly, the earliest, early morning (8 AM) lab appointment I could get is after my scheduled annual Medicare physical. If I truly don't need to fast I can move that to a date before the office visit so after answering the above , please confirm no fasting required. \n",

    "Provider Response by AFP CARE TEAM POOL:\n",
    "Hi Don, This is Irene Kwan, FNP-C responding on behalf of Dr. John Carper. In general, sometimes certain lab tests are not always ordered on a yearly basis, and only ordered if clinically necessary.  For example, CBC may not be needed if there is no sign of fatigue, weakness, blood loss, history of anemia, or concerning presence of infection. Sometimes Medicare also does not cover for certain tests if deemed not medically necessary or at risk, thus patients may have to pay out of pocket for tests requested by the patient. Your metabolic panel test will check for a fasting blood sugar, and if it is elevated, then we can always check hemoglobin A1c with a fingerstick blood check in office. Your labs ordered on 11/1/2024 are recommended to be fasting so that we can accurately check your glucose level and lipid (cholesterol) levels.  Thank you for your understanding, and should you have further questions about lab tests, it can be discussed at your upcoming appointment. Best, Alameda Family PhysiciansIrene Kwan, FNP-C, on behalf of Dr. John Carper(510)521-2300Please note that MyHealth messages are meant for non-urgent concerns that can be answered by a simple email response.

    "2025-06-17 14:10:57,245 - Sender: MYCHART, GENERIC [ T200162] -> the retrieved similar message : Hi Dr. Tsao,I got my blood tests results yesterday, and I‚Äôm very worried that my Glucose is high. It was slightly outside the normal range for non-fasting, and way outside the normal range for fasting. I didn‚Äôt fast but the only thing I ate was oatmeal and eggs and it was about 4 hours before the blood draw so I was very surprised that the glucose level wasn‚Äôt closer to the normal fasting range, and I assume it‚Äôs related my pancreas function. As you know, I‚Äôm very worried about pancreatic cancer.I am eager to get your analysis about it, and any other concerns about other test results, and to move quickly on whatever next step I should take.I am still struggling to eat food and still feeling discomfort after I do eat. Thank you,Ritsuko\n",

Please note, Your results will release immediately, likely before I can review them.  Once I review your results, which may be up to 3-4 business days, I will send comments regarding the results.    We can check another test to make sure your blood sugar average (A1C) is in normal range as your fasting and non-fasting blood sugar can react to when you ate, what you ate, stress, etc.  Your A1C has been ordered and sent electronically to Labcorp to be done non-fasting.  You do not need to have the paper orders, but you can print them out at home through MyHealth (under tests-> ordered tests).  You should try to schedule an appointment for your test at the lab (online or by phone), as they can be busy.  Your results will release immediately, likely before I can review them.  Once I review your results, which may be up to 3-4 business days, I will send comments regarding the results.    Your white blood cell count was slightly low, but improved from your previous which is usually low.  Your thyroid hormone, electrolytes, pancrease enzymes, liver and kidney function are normal.  Your H.pylori stool test is negative for infection.  Please follow up with Dr. Cheng regarding your GI symptoms.

    "  - **Physical Exam:** Record each PE subfield as completely as possible. If side-specific findings are present (e.g., right/left ear), include these in the most granular field appropriate.\n",

If a complaint is new (e.g., from a patient message, not the prior note), include your clinical response as an entry.\n",
    "  - **Instructions:** General instructions (e.g., when to follow up, how to schedule) should be recorded in \"general_guidelines\"; pharmacy details as specified.\n",

    "  - **Additional Notes:** Include any clinical details, context, or provider action plans not clearly fitting in the other structured fields.\n",

    "  **Strict Guidelines:**\n",

    "  - Do not summarize or condense the patient's clinical complaints or history; preserve their language and details in the output.\n",

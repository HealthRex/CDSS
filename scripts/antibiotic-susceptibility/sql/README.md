# Antibiotic Susceptibility Queries

This repository contains SQL queries and supporting documentation for the antibiotic susceptibility project. 
The goal is to provide a comprehensive set of rules for inferring antibiotic susceptibility, which can be used to inform clinical decisions and support ongoing research.

## Contents

- `implied_suscept.sql`: The main SQL script that creates a table for inferred antibiotic susceptibilities and populates it with both explicit and implied data.
- `docs/`: A directory containing related documentation and project notes.

## Usage

To use the `implied_suscept.sql` script:

2. Execute the SQL script within your database environment.
3. Review the `implied_suscept` table for the inferred susceptibility data.

Please refer to the comments within the script for detailed information on how the inference rules are applied.

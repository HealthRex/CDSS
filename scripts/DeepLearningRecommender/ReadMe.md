## ClinicNet and ClinicLSTM Deep Learning Recommender Engine
*Authors: Delaney Sullivan, Jonathan Wang, Alex Wells, Adam Wells*

Hello, welcome to the HealthRex DeepLearning Recommender Github Folder!

Here you can find the files we use for automated patient progression prediction and clinical decision support through deep neural networks.

---
* ClinicNet is our FeedForward Model 	
* ClinicLSTM is our RNN model (may need load_and_format_data, rnn_data_wrapper, and create_batches files to preprocess data) 	
* human_authored_baseline allows one to compare results directly to the performance of human authored order sets.

Our data was first extracted using the Feature Matrix Factory, located in the analysis folder.

##ClinicNet and ClinicLSTM Deep Learning Recommender Engine
Hello, welcome to the HealthRex DeepLearning Recommender Github Folder!
Authors: Delaney Sullivan, Jonathan Wang, Alex Wells, Adam Wells

Here you can find the files we use for automated patient progression prediction and clinical decision support through deep neural networks.

ClinicNet is our FeedForward Model
ClinicLSTM is our RNN model (may need load_and_format_data, rnn_data_wrapper, and create_batches files to preprocess data)

Our data was first extracted using the Feature Matrix Factory located in the analaysis folder.

/********************************************************************************************
Purpose: Checks for a DRG-PCS (procedure) cohort
Author: Selina Pi
Date run: 2/24/23
Notes:
-- SQL queries under each "#" comment should be copied and run separately in BigQuery editor
-- In APR-DRG 230/231 cohort, patients with procedure code 0DBB0ZZ	- Excision of Ileum, Open Approach 
  and 0DJD8ZZ	- Inspection of Lower Intestinal Tract, Endo were most common. This program
  explores these procedure cohorts with Bigquery

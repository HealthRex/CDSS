--Is there more than one cost line per IP visit? Same question/different query: Within the cost data, can one day or episode have multiple costs? (By cursory view of results of the above query, looks like total IP costs are collapsed per visit, and I'm not seeing overlapping non-IP costs)
--Do IP cost lines' dates line up with the admission date (By cursory view of results of the above query, it seems so)?
--Are there non-IP costs in the hospitalization?
--Do all hospitalizations in the cost time frame have cost data?
--Do hospitalizations ever have overlapping dates?

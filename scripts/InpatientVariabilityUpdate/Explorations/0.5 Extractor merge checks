# Check AHRQ-CCSR and diagnosis data mapping for PatientProblemGroup Extractor; Conclusions: joining on replace statement (substituting out periods in clinical data) leads to better match, but we are missing CCSR groups for ICD codes concatenated with commas in the same line and some corner cases like B60.00

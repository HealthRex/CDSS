Description: Collection of SQL BigQuery pulls to explore SHC clinical and cost data.

Instructions:
-- The file title numbering denotes the order in which queries were originally run, and queries within each file were run in order. For example, the pulls in "0.1 DRG burden.sql" were run first, followed by 0.2, 0.3, etc. However, each individual query is independent and can be run in BigQuery without running any previous queries first.
-- SQL queries under each "#" comment should be copied and run separately in BigQuery editor
-- See InpatientVariabilityUpdate readme file for access steps for HealthRex BigQuery databases

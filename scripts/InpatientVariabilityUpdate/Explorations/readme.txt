Collection of SQL BigQuery pulls to explore SHC clinical and cost data. Individual SQL queries under each comment starting with "#" were copy-pasted directly into the BigQuery editor.

The file title numbering denotes the order in which queries were run, and queries within each file were run in order. For example, the pulls in 0.1 DRG_burden were run first, followed by 0.2, 0.3, etc.

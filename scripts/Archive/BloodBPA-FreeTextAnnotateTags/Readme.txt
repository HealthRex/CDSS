- overrideComments.txt - Text file with collection of text strings (e.g., one per line in a text file) of override comments studying

- extractWordCounts.py - Reads though the overrideComments.txt file to inventory a count of all of the words/tokens/chunks that appear in the text strings to produce an overrideWords.txt file

- wordTags.txt - Open overrideWords.txt in Excel as a tab-delimited file and then manually go through all of the list of words generated by the above in a spreadsheet and add an extra column if the presence of a word should automatically trigger a tag/label for a category (e.g., Surgery, Discharge, Symptomatic) to create a wordTags.txt tab-delimited file.

- autoAnnotate.py - Go back though the overrideComments.txt data, and try to automatically guess which categories/tags each line belongs to, based on the simple wordTag assignment rules defined above.

- mergeTags.py - If different human annotators come up with slightly different categories/tags ("surgery" vs. "surgical" vs. "pending operation"), then use this script with a TagMergeWorksheet.txt to relabel or otherwise merge the choice of tags.

- calcAgreementStats.py - After two human annotators have finalized their list of annotation tags for each text string, this script will calculate how often their tag/category assignments agreed with each other in terms of Kappa measure as well as chi-square and component contingency table numbers.

RPR often eventually decreases to the point of seroreversion but a \u201cserofast\u201d state sometimes exists where an RPR stays positive at low levels. Particularly when RPR titers are low at diagnosis (1:1, 1:2, or 1:4), titers may not decline, which does not necessarily reflect treatment failure": "***"

SPECIAL NOTE: Please DO NOT place eConsults for second opinions, established Cardiology patients, or to fast track a referral.
In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:
ASSESSMENTS:

ASCVD risk score
DIAGNOSTICS:
EKG

BMP
Lipid profile
HbA1c
CLINICAL PEARLS:
From Choosing Wisely:
Don’t perform cardiac imaging in patients who are low risk
Don’t perform stress cardiac imaging or advanced noninvasive imaging in the initial evaluation of patients without cardiac symptoms unless high-risk markers are present
Stable patients with symptoms suggestive of angina and intermediate or high pre-test likelihood of CHD are generally appropriate for stress testing
Exercise ECG treadmill test should be the initial test for the majority of patients who can exercise adequately, who have an interpretable ECG, and who do not have certain conditions (e.g. LBBB, paced ventricular rhythm, ventricular pre-excitation, etc.)
Pharmacologic stress testing with myocardial imaging is typically performed when a patient is unable to exercise
Asymptomatic patients >40 y/o at intermediate risk (7.5-19.9% 10-year ASCVD risk) or borderline elevated risk (5-6.4% 10-year ASCVD risk) with family h/o premature ASCVD should undergo measurement of coronary artery calcium (CAC) score to possibly help determine statin treatment and intensity of ASCVD risk factor modification.
Patients at low (<5% 10-year ASCVD risk) or high (>20% 10-year ASCVD risk) should not undergo CAC measurement as the results are unlikely to change treatment approach.}

Established Patient – new template – Internal eConsults only
DO NOT place an eConsult to cardiology if the patient is already established with a cardiologist (within SHC or external).

DO NOT place an eConsult to fast track a patient to see cardiology.
eConsults are for specific clinical questions. The intended purpose of eConsults is not to ask logistical questions or to fast track patients to be seen by a given specialty. Thank you for your understanding.
For clinically urgent cardiology referrals – place usual cardiology referral through Epic and update referral class to ‘urgent.’ Please provide specific details regarding the urgent clinical needs of the patient to enable expeditious triage of the referral.

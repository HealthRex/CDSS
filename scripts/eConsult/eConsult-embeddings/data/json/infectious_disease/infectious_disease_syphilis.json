For example, an appropriate serologic response to treatment would be a decrease in RPR from 1:128 to 1:32. RPR often eventually decreases to the point of seroreversion but a “serofast” state sometimes exists where an RPR stays positive at low levels. Particularly when RPR titers are low at diagnosis (1:1, 1:2, or 1:4), titers may not decline, which does not necessarily reflect treatment failure": "***"

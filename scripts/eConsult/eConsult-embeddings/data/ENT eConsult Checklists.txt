Sinusitis
My Clinical Question (condition: sinusitis): ***
My most current assessment of this problem can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
{INFORMATIONAL:PRESS F2 and DELETE KEY before signing
In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:
Nasal stuffiness or congestion?  Nasal blockage or obstruction?  Which side is worse? Facial pain/pressure? Decreased smell? Mucopurulent nasal drainage?
Are the symptoms occurring every day, all day, or they come and go?  Does patient feel normal between episodes?  Is the length of time of symptoms less than 1 month or more than 3 months?
History of prior surgeries?  History of prior imaging?  History of prior trauma? History of allergy testing?
Have saline sprays been tried?  Saline irrigations?  How frequently?  Change in symptoms?  Nasal steroid sprays?  Nasal steroid irrigations such as budesonide?  Antibiotics and if so which ones and for how long? Other medications?
Tests recommended by ENT:
None for acute symptoms (less than 1 month)
For sinus symptoms that have lasted longer than 3 months, should obtain a non-contrast CT Sinus for objective confirmation.
Clinical pearls:
Consider migraine headache as common mimic of chronic sinusitis especially if main symptom is pain with lack of nasal symptoms
Trial of saline irrigation twice a day for at least one month and nasal steroids for at least one month prior to referral}
Tinnitus
My Clinical Question (condition: tinnitus): ***
My most current assessment of this problem can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
{INFORMATIONAL:PRESS F2 and DELETE KEY before signing
In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:
Tinnitus is any sound that the patient hears that can be heard by others (objective) vs only heard by patient(subjective)
Which side?  Constant or comes and goes?  Pulsatile?  Does the pulsations correlate with patient’s heartbeat?  What makes the tinnitus worse or better?  Does it correlate with breathing?
Associated hearing loss?
Ototoxic medications?  Trauma?  Foreign body in ear?
Drainage?  Ear pain?  Describe pain?  Vertigo (vertigo is an illusion of motion)?
Hearing aids?
Tests recommended by ENT:
Audiogram
Clinical pearls:
If no hearing loss, consider referral to audiology alone
For sudden sensorineural hearing loss, call ENT for urgent eval and consider high dose steroid burst (60 mg/day prednisone)}
Other

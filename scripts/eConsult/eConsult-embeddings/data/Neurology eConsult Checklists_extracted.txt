SPECIAL NOTE: Please DO NOT place eConsults for patients who already have a Neurologist/second opinions, acute/emergent/urgent concerns, fast tracking a referral, chronic refractory pain, fibromyalgia, Lyme disease, long Covid, and CRPS (Chronic regional pain syndrome).
ASSESSMENTS:
Required:
Description of the abnormal finding
Films and imaging report available for review (if done outside of Stanford)
Relevant details related to the initial reason for the study
Previous imaging for comparison
Neurologic symptoms
Examination of cranial nerves, strength, reflexes, sensation, and gait
Optional:
Prior neurological evaluations
CLINICAL PEARLS:
In the setting of a normal neurologic exam, nonspecific white matter disease on MRI brain, with one spot per decade of life, can be normal.
Patients with migraine tend to have more “nonspecific white matter changes” on MRI brain.
On MRI spine, mild to moderate neural foraminal narrowing or central canal narrowing may not necessarily cause symptoms. Mild to moderate degenerative changes become more common with age, and can be asymptomatic.
Multiple sclerosis, or other demyelinating conditions, cannot be diagnosed based on MRI findings alone. Clinical symptoms and exam findings must correlate to imaging.}

ASSESSMENTS:
Required:
Description of movement (please include whether occurs at rest, with action or both)
Location of movement
Onset
Exacerbating and relieving factors
Whether there is associated pain
Whether there is a change in ADLs
Examination of strength, reflexes, and sensation
Prior neurological evaluations
DIAGNOSTICS:
None
CLINICAL PEARLS:
Consider the following common, benign movement disorders that may not require neurology consultation (depending on duration, severity, accompanying symptoms):
Physiologic Myoclonus (a brief involuntary twitching of muscles often increased by sleep deprivation, stress, narcotics)
Eyelid twitching
Brief involuntary twitching can potentially be made worse by sleep deprivation, stress, and some medications. Mild twitching in the absence of changes in strength or reflexes is usually physiologic and does not require neurologic consultation.
Common medications that cause tremor: lithium, valproic acid, stimulants, SSRI’s, SNRI’s. Check the prescribing information as many medications cause tremor.
For bilateral action tremor without other neurologic signs or symptoms, consider diagnosis of essential tremor. Consider trial of propranolol or gabapentin.}

- Neurologic symptoms/signs: Change in mental status or level of consciousness, diplopia, abnormal cranial nerve function, pulsatile tinnitus, loss of sensation, weakness, ataxia, history of seizure/collapse/loss of consciousness
- Onset sudden: Onset sudden or first ever, severe or “worst” headache of life, thunderclap headache (pain reaches maximal intensity instantly after onset)
- Older Onset: Onset after 50 years of age
- Pattern change: Progressive headache, precipitated by Valsalva maneuver, postural aggravation, papilledema
In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:
ASSESSMENTS:
Required:
Onset of headache (days/weeks/months/years ago), frequency, duration, location, type of pain and severity
Medications or other strategies tried abortively and/or preventively
Exacerbating and alleviating factors  (including presence of thunderclap, association with orgasm or autonomic signs – such as sweating/tearing/conjunctival injection)
Other associated symptoms (photophobia, nausea, etc)

Full neurologic exam
What is your working diagnosis for this patient's headache?
Migraine (Severe, recurrent, disabling, nauseating)
Suspected migrainous neurological accompaniments (History of migraine or other migrainous accompaniments including photo/phonophobia and nausea, PLUS vision or sensory changes, vertigo and/or weakness)
Vestibular migraine (episodic vertigo with history of migraine)
Tension-type headache (non-descript, non-nauseating)
Cluster headache (severe, unilateral, generally periorbital, brief < 2 hours, with automatic features – unilateral eye redness, tearing, etc)
Medication overuse headache
Other
Optional:
Imaging (if available)
Previous neurology evaluation (if available)
DIAGNOSTICS:
Required:
None
Optional:
CT Head w/o contrast
MRI Brain w/w/o contrast
CLINICAL PEARLS:
Good sleep, hydration, exercise, and avoidance of problematic habits are crucial for chronic headache management.
Reassuring signs that suggest no need for imaging are: intense form of typical headache, normal neurologic exam, typical triggers, and response to appropriate therapy.
Patients with stable, episodic disabling headache (without alarm signs) may be considered to have migraine and given a trial of appropriate medication
Consider use of amitriptyline (age < 65) or nortriptyline, topiramate, or vascular agents (e.g. amlodipine, nadolol, losartan) as first line for migraine prophylaxis, and assess effectiveness at 6-8 weeks
75% of Medication Overuse Headache (abortive medication used more than 3 days per week) will improve within 2 months after taper/cessation of offending medications.
Avoid frequent use (more than 3x/wk) of abortive agents-- Excedrin, ibuprofen, and triptans. Avoid high risk medications like narcotics altogether.
If patient is requiring abortive medications more than 3x per week, consider preventive medications}

In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:
SPECIAL NOTE: Please DO NOT place eConsults for patients who already have a Neurologist/second opinions, acute/emergent/urgent concerns, fast tracking a referral, chronic refractory pain, fibromyalgia, Lyme disease, long Covid, and CRPS (Chronic regional pain syndrome).

DIAGNOSTICS:
Required:
None
Optional:
BMP
B12
HgbA1c
Fasting glucose
Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)
SPEP
CLINICAL PEARLS:
Pain without any focal neurologic features is rarely secondary to a well-defined neurologic condition and neurologic consultation rarely will be helpful. Pain consultation may be more appropriate.
Neurology Consultation is most likely helpful for:
Pain with neuropathic features (burning, tingling, foreign body sensation, very short attacks/paroxysmal), or when other neurologic symptoms/signs are present. If this is the case, and depending on the severity of symptoms, treatment for neuropathic pain (e.g. gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline) should be started by the PCP team. Full consultation may not be needed if the etiology is clear (e.g. diabetes, postherpetic).
Radicular pain originates in the neck or back and radiates in a dermatomal distribution into the limbs. Weakness is an additional clue. If weakness is present, consider spinal imaging.  New onset weakness should be referred for consultation.
Procedural treatment of radicular pain is done by PM&R (through ortho or neurosurgery) or Pain Clinic rather than neurology (only for internal template)
EMG/NCS testing is not necessary in all cases.

-Was the headache of sudden onset, reaching maximum intensity within seconds
-Other neurologic symptoms
-Is the headache disabling i.e. interfering with work or daily life
-Brain imaging
-Previous neurology evaluation
CLINICAL PEARLS:
Before submitting an eConsult be sure you have discussed the following with the patient:
sedentary lifestyle, daily caffeine use, smoking, medication overuse (use of abortive medications more than 2-3 days per week for prolonged periods, including over the counter medications), stress and depression.
Do NOT initiate frequent treatment (greater than once per week) with butalbital and/or narcotic medications.
Consider an MRI of the head if headaches are daily/constant (especially if progressive)
Red Flags – Consider urgent/inpatient evaluation

Numbness – Penn State template
CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT FROM NEUROLOGY:
>> NOTE: Neurology consults is most helpful when:
+ pain with neuropathic features
++burning
++ tingling
++ foreign body sensation
++ very short attacks/paroxysmal
>>NOTE: Pain clinic referral  may be appropriate in lieu or neurology referral if:
+ Pain is without any focal neurologic problems
+ Pain is not associated with the above neuropathic features
>> WFBH Neurology requires the following to be included in the clinical question:
+ symptom duration
+ symptom frequency (intermittent, persistent, or constant)
+ location of numbness
+ Additional symptoms that presented in conjunction:
++ visual disturbance?
++ vertigo?
++ headache?
++ speech disturbance?
++ dysphagia?
++ associative pain in the affected area?
++ significant weakness in the affected area?
++ bladder/bowel dysfunction present?
+ Medications (including doses) prescribed for numbness/sensory symptoms
+ Lab evaluation:
++ Vitamin B12
++ Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)
++ Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)
++ Complete Metabolic Panel (CMP)
++ Complete Blood Count (CBC)
>> If neuroimaging has been performed (not required), please provide results
>> If electromyography has been performed (not required), please provide results
>> If EMG performed has been performed (not required), please provide results

My Clinical Question (condition: alcohol): ***
My most current assessment of this problem can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
{INFORMATIONAL:PRESS F2 and DELETE KEY before signing
In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:
Is the patient pregnant or planning to become pregnant? There are no safe alcohol limits in pregnancy.
Is the patient using tobacco, is it combustible or vaped, and are they interested in cutting back or stopping?
Last known alcohol drink?
Pattern of drinking? How many alcohol drinks is the patient having daily or weekly?
Is the patient currently experiencing withdrawal symptoms--anxiety, irritability, tremors, sweats, cravings to drink?
History of alcohol withdrawal--severity, complications, treatment or hospitalization required?
Are they currently using other substances such as opioids, benzodiazepines, cannabis or stimulants?
Any seizure history?
Has the patient been in substance use treatment before and would they be amenable to returning to treatment?
Test recommended by chemical dependency:
CMP (specifically AST, ALT, GGT, T bili)
UTox
CBC (specifically H/H and MCV)
Not required for consult, but suggest STD Screening if not done recently: HIV, RPR/VDRL, GC, Chlamydia, HCV for all SUD patients
Clinical pearls:
If your patient has a history of severe alcohol withdrawal as manifested by known seizure history, delirium tremens, or withdrawal requiring hospitalization because of metabolic derangement or altered consciousness, they would need to be admitted again if they are exhibiting similar signs.
If your patient is interested in reducing alcohol use, you may conduct an AUDIT-C:
https://www.mdcalc.com/audit-c-alcohol-use
If scoring suggesting misuse (Males score ≥4; Females score ≥3), or pt exhibits binge drinking (Males consuming 5 or more drinks; Females and elderly consuming 4 or more drinks in about 2-3 hours):
COUNSEL on safe limits, and how alcohol is a carcinogen, pro-inflammatory and interferes with medications, sleep, and over time with continued exposure will increase risk for developing severe alcohol dependence.
SUGGEST that they cut back usage to no more than 7 drinks per week and schedule a return visit to assess attempts and motivation to change.
Chemical Dependency can help guide the following (consider an eConsult if you want to advice on how to lead this management within your practice, or place a “Referral to Chemical Dependency” to refer a patient to our services to manage in the short-term)
To reduce craving/cut back alcohol use:
NALTREXONE (opioid blockade; can also be used to maintain abstinence)
TOPIRIMATE (Also useful for comorbid obesity, binge eating disorder and migraine prophylaxis)
If a patient would like to stop drinking and you are concerned about alcohol withdrawal, calculate the CIWA-Ar (https://www.mdcalc.com/ciwa-ar-alcohol-withdrawal) to determine severity of withdrawal and help guide management
N.B. Very few people who are getting sick with withdrawal symptoms will carry through with treatment if these symptoms are not managed clinically.
BENZODIAZEPINES are used to control psychomotor agitation and prevent progression to severe withdrawal: gabapentin, chlordiazepoxide, oxazepam
CLONIDINE: for autonomic hyperactivity
For maintenance of abstinence:
ACOMPROSATE (second-line to reduce craving/cut back)
DISULFURAM/ANTABUSE

Benzodiazepines
My Clinical Question (condition: benzodiazepines): ***
My most current assessment of this problem can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
{INFORMATIONAL:PRESS F2 and DELETE KEY before signing
In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:
Is your concern chronic benzodiazepines for anxiety, insomnia, or pain and a desire to help taper the patient? Or does this person have a benzodiazepine use disorder (e.g. using street xanax or taking more than you are prescribing)?
Is the patient pregnant or planning to become pregnant?
Is the patient using tobacco, is it combustible or vaped, and are they interested in cutting back or stopping?
Type, amount, frequency of benzodiazepine usage?
Suspected/known other substance use disorders? Psychiatric diagnoses?
Other medical comorbidities?
Most recent CURES report appropriate? (You may go under COMPACT MESSAGING under patient’s CURES report and message a physician of any concerns of co-prescribing)
Does the patient wish to taper?
Or are you concerned about safety, especially if it is co-prescribed with opioids?
Test recommended by chemical dependency:
UTox - recall the active metabolites of diazepam include temazepam
Not necessary for consult, but recommend STD Screening if not done recently: HIV, RPR/VDRL, GC, Chlamydia, HCV for all SUD patients
Clinical pearls:
N.B: Long-term benzodiazepine exposure results in downregulation of the GABA/inhibitory response and upregulation of the excitatory neurotransmitter system, benzodiazepine withdrawal is often painful, difficult and tapering may take many months to years. Withdrawal can include severe, chronic paresthesias, photosensitivity, tinnitus, anxiety, insomnia, to name a few.
For a very helpful manual on all things benzodiazepines including sample taper schedules: Ashton Manual:  https://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/
Helpful phrasing for counseling patients about long term benzodiazepine use: “Tolerance to anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines seems to develop more slowly, but there is little evidence that benzodiazepines retain their effectiveness after 4 months of regular treatment and clinical observations suggest that long-term benzodiazepine use over the years does little to control, and may even aggravate, anxiety states.” (From the Ashton Manual)
Withdrawal from benzodiazepines are similar to alcohol withdrawal, and may include seizures. Benzodiazepine withdrawals may occur in as rapidly as two (2) weeks of treatment, and severity depends on the potency, half-life and length of treatment.
Benzodiazepines should always be tapered with care and driven by the patient’s readiness
Golden Rule of Benzo tapers: “never go back up” once a small incremental drop in dose has taken place (sometimes no more than 5-10% at a time), stay at that same dose for at least 4 weeks. A patient may hold a dose for an additional 4-6 weeks if they do not feel ready to drop the dose again, however, do not increase the dose back up.
In order to reduce the temptation to increase the dose, refill only 2 weeks at a time and conduct pill counts or do not refill early.
Adjunctive medications such as gapapentinoids (gabapentin, pregabalin), or other anti-convulsants such as carbamazepine may be used to help ameliorate withdrawal symptoms.
For smaller incremental tapers that are not available in the standard formulary, compounding pharmacies may be used:

https://www.safeway.com/pharmacy/pharmacy-services/compounding-services.html
Another method of reduction instead of tapering the original benzodiazepine that is likely shorter acting such as lorazepam, alprazolam, or clonazepam, is to swap out one of the doses taken during a BID, TID or QID dosing schedule with a longer acting benzodiazepine such as chlordiazepoxide (Librium) or diazepam (Valium) which self tapers into active metabolites such as nor-diazepam and oxazepam.
After all doses are transitioned to chlordiazepoxide or diazepam, then this may be tapered relatively safely and effectively because it is so long acting
As a patient tapers, be sure to monitor and openly discuss other substance use, which may restart or increase (e.g. alcohol, cannabis, opioids), and ask about “natural” treatments they may try (e.g. valerian root, kratom).}
Cannabis
My Clinical Question (condition: cannabis): ***
My most current assessment of this problem can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
{INFORMATIONAL:PRESS F2 and DELETE KEY before signing
In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:
Is the patient pregnant or planning to become pregnant?
Is the patient using tobacco, is it combustible or vaped, and are they interested in cutting back or stopping?
Type, route, amount, frequency of cannabis usage?
Attempts to cut back or stop cannabis use?
Effects on occupational, academic or social functioning?
Is the patient psychotic?  Do they have psychiatric illness?
Suspected/known other substance use disorders?
Other medical comorbidities?
Family history of SUD or psychotic illness?
Test recommended by chemical dependency:
UTox
Not required for consult but recommended: STD Screening if not done recently--HIV, RPR/VDRL, GC, Chlamydia, HCV for all SUD patients

Cannabis use disorder does exist; there is tolerance and withdrawal.
Cannabis use can be very difficult to stop and motivation to stop difficult to achieve especially in the climate of legalization and decriminalization.
The greatest harm of cannabis accessibility is to our youth. Counseling on parents or adults who influence youth can be a motivator to stop or decrease use in adults.
Early use of cannabis before age 18 increases risk of long term cannabis use disorder and cognitive changes that may be irreversible.
Anxiety is an often an underlying pre-morbid condition to cannabis dependence and treating the underlying anxiety may help decrease cannabis use or help facilitate abstinence.
There are no FDA approved medications for cannabis use disorder and meta- analysis looking at SSRI, mixed action antidepressants, atypical antidepressants, etc did not prove efficacious in treating cannabis dependence, however they may help in treating the underlying comorbid psychiatric disorder. There is weak evidence for gabapentin and N-acetyl cysteine however this does not preclude one from trying these agents
For patients who have stopped use and you or they would like to monitor their declining levels, one must order THC and creatinine level and follow the THC:creatinine ratio, as absolute levels may not correlate with abstinence.  THC stores are excreted from adipose tissue into urine, so the levels may not fall in a linear fashion.
Frequent follow ups and monitoring use over time is an important first step in a primary care practice.}

Many patients with chronic pain benefit from multimodal chronic pain treatment, including non-opioid medications (systemic and/or topical), coaching about pacing and physical activity, cognitive behavioral therapy with individual or group sessions, patient education (including newer tools such as the Curable app).

Golden Rule of Opioid tapers: “never go back up” once a small incremental drop in dose has taken place (sometimes no more than 5-10% at a time), stay at that same dose for at least 4 weeks. A patient may hold a dose for an additional 4-6 weeks if they do not feel ready to drop the dose again, however, do not increase the dose back up.
Explanation of how to determine a taper schedule:  In general it is often helpful to ask the patient to detail their usual daily schedule of opioid use, on a typical day, e.g.:
First wake up at 6 am, takes 2 tabs Norco 5, go back to sleep
Wake up again at 10 am, takes 2 tabs Norco 5
3 pm: 2 tabs of Norco 5
9 pm: 2 tabs of Norco 5
11 pm: bed
Note that this patient is being prescribed 8 tabs of Norco 5 daily, or 240 tabs for a 30 day supply
Once you have determined the patient’s usual daily schedule, ask them which dose they would like to taper first.  For this patient, they pick the 3 pm dose.  For their very first taper step, you could reduce their 3 pm dose from 2 tabs of Norco 5 to 1.5 tabs of Norco 5.
Now, their new total daily prescription will be 7.5 tabs of Norco 5 instead of 8 tabs, and their prescription for 4 weeks (28 days) will be 7.5*28 = 210 tabs.
Note that during a taper, it is especially helpful to prescribe in 7 day increments, max 28 days at a time, to allow more precise monitoring of quantity used and avoid refilling on weekends.
In order to reduce the temptation to increase the dose, refill only 2 weeks at a time and conduct pill counts or do not refill early
Adjunctive medications such as gapapentinoids (gabapentin, pregabalin), clonidine, tylenol, dicyclomine, etc. ameliorate withdrawal symptoms. Also optimize adjunctive pain medicines such as duloxetine, nortriptyline etc.

There is limited evidence of efficacy for chronic opioids in chronic pain.  Physicians should carefully weigh long-term harms and benefits.  For more information about this issue, see Annals of Internal Medicine systematic review:
https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M14-2559
There is limited evidence that pain levels and functionality can be maintained or improved with appropriately slow and individualized opioid tapers, please see systematic review also in Annals of Internal Medicine:

Acne – Arista/UCSF template
* Tips for effective dermatology photos
1. First photo - wide view to evaluate anatomic region and general distribution of the eruption.
2. Second photo - detailed, close-up image with lesion no closer than 20 cm and camera on macro settings. Can send additional macro photos from different angles to illustrate details and textural features of the lesion.
3. If possible, third photo with ruler close to lesion to demarcate lesion size.

CLINICAL PEARLS:
Topical retinoids are best for predominantly comedonal Acne (not pustular
Consider topical antibiotics for mild pustular acne (combination if some of both)
Oral antibiotics if moderate to severe: doxycycline 100mg daily is better than minocycline
Refer for oral isotretinoin if refractory to above, or scarring/nodular acne.
Treat for 2 months with good compliance before assessing results
Consider spironolactone for adult female acne, 50-100mg daily, though counsel on menstrual irregularities, fatigue, med interactions, and teratogenicity
Trial all meds for 2 months at least before assessing improvement

Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea:  redness of cheeks that’s episodic  Usually doesn’t respond to topical/oral abx: refer for laser

Alopecia – Arista/UCSF template
ASSESSMENTS:
Required:
None
Optional:
What is the distribution of the alopecia?
Any medications?
Age of onset.
Any family history of alopecia?

DIAGNOSTICS:
Required:
Complete Blood Count (CBC)
Free Thyroxine (Free T4)
Photo
Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)
Serum iron
Serum Ferritin
Optional:
Skin Biopsy
CLINICAL PEARLS:
If classic AA/androgenetic:  TSH/CBC/IRON
For androgenetic:  Consider a course of minoxidil topical; for men finasteride for 6 Months
Refer based on impact on quality of life.
Average person loses 60-100 hairs per day.
Hair loss is a very common problem. The most common etiologies are familial, aging, and postpartum physiologic changes. Unless the patient has strong family history and/or compelling review of systems to suggest autoimmunity (e.g., oral ulcers, sun sensitivity, inflammatory arthritis), the pre-test probability is low and we recommend against checking ANA. The consequences of a false positive ANA are patient angst, unnecessary additional referral and work-up.
If patient has major surgery or trauma, extreme psychological stress, childbirth or chemotherapy within the past 4 months, hair loss is likely due to telogen/anagen effluvium. Symptoms are expected to improve with a few months with resolution of the causative factor.
Androgenic/senescent alopecia is typically characterized by thinning of hairs on the temples and crown and thinning, shorter, wispier hair. For androgenetic/senescent alopecia, patient should use topical minoxidil (Rogaine) 5% ONCE DAILY for at least 8 months. Minoxidil 5% is safe for men AND was recently FDA-approved for women. It can be applied to all scalp areas of hair thinning (not just crown), but the patient must put on enough to thinly coat the scalp. The foam vehicle is less irritating than the liquid and can be purchased in bulk to save money. Set expectations that this is life-long therapy that maintains hairs. 30% of people have moderate regrowth, 30% have no net loss (but not additional growth).
Abort eConsult and order a consult to Dermatology if the patient has signs of alopecia areata (patchy hair loss), shiny scars in areas of alopecia, inflammation/redness, pain or pustules. Prior to being seen by Dermatology the patient should have a TSH with reflex free T4 and ferritin within the past 4 months
(and treatment provided if abnormal). Ferritin should be >35 for optimal regrowth.
Prior to the eConsult to Dermatology, the patient should have a TSH with reflex free T4 and ferritin within the past 4 months (and treatment provided if abnormal). Ferritin should be >35 for optimal regrowth.
Atopic dermatitis/Eczema – Arista/UCSF template
Tips for the best images with a clean lens:
1.	First photo: wide view - your forearm’s length is the camera distance from skin, to show anatomic region and hyperpigmented/red/scaly/excoriated area in context. Try with and without flash and avoid your shadow in the image. Make sure the largest part of the image in the viewfinder is the skin, otherwise only the background will be in focus. Typical areas would be face, trunk, buttocks, forearms and palms
2.	Closeup photo: 2 fingertip widths or more from skin. Make sure you include a border area showing normally pigmented skin. Camera on macro (tulip symbol) setting. No ruler is needed. If the lesion is dark, the camera may read a light background and make the affected area appear even darker. Try shots with and without flash. Typical areas would be nails, antecubital and popliteal fossae, cheeks, dorsal hands, ankles
CLINICAL PEARLS:
Surprisingly, adult-onset atopic dermatitis is increasingly common, especially after age 50. If there is no history of childhood atopy, but the pattern looks typical of atopic dermatitis, please consider it as a diagnosis.
ASSESSMENTS:
Required:
Description of area(s)of dermatitis and largest diameter in mm.

CLINICAL PEARLS:
Use low potency steroids only, for up to 3 weeks, on face or skin folds (See LINK for types).   Consider tacro/pimecrolimus in those needing longer therapy
High potency steroids for trunk or extremities—limit 2 weeks; then off for at least 2 weeks.
Consider PO antibiotic treatment in refractory, impetiginized eczema
Refer to derm for patients who, with good adherence and use of emollients, can’t gain/keep control after 2-4 weeks of high potency topical steroids.
Good skin hygiene:
Take warm, short (10 min) showers (daily okay). Always follow showers with bland (no perfume) emollients. Long baths are very drying to skin.
Wash with liquid lotion infused body cleansers – not bar soap (dove/Olay body soap)
Avoid fragrance in soaps/cleansers/creams (e.g. Dove / Cetaphil / CeraVe / Curel / Vanicream brands are good OTC products, etc.)
Use creams (thicker) rather than lotions to moisturize

Do not do serologic work up (ANA, CBC, CMP, etc) unless history supports specific cause
In adults: scratch/allergy testing is usually negative. Refer only if history is supportive of external cause
Most common cause is children = concurrent URI; adults = drug/supplement
90% of time cause of hives unable to ascertained
First line tx:  non-sedating antihistamine; if no contraindications (CV/kidney dz), can give Zyrtec/Claritin up to 4x normal dose (40mg total a day)
Can try sedating antihistamine at night as well (Benadryl, atarax)
Prednisone will work, but hives may flare with taper

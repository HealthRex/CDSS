My Clinical Question (condition: Anaphylaxis): ***
My most current assessment of this problem can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
{INFORMATIONAL:PRESS F2 and DELETE KEY before signing
In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:
Most recent reaction
First reaction
Total number of reactions
Suspected trigger(s)
Tests recommended by Allergy:
Tryptase (within 3 hours of an acute reaction and/or a baseline level)
Clinical Pearls:
Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction involving multiple organ systems. Symptoms can include lightheadedness/dizziness (from low blood pressure), nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, hives, angioedema, and/or shortness of breath/wheezing. If multiple organ systems are not involved, classification as anaphylaxis may not be appropriate.}
My Clinical Question (condition: Angioedema): ***
My most current assessment of this problem can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
{INFORMATIONAL:PRESS F2 and DELETE KEY before signing
In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:
Any identifying causes (i.e. NSAIDs, ACEs/ARBs, estrogens, new or significant increases in medications)
Presence of signs/symptoms of allergic reaction/mast cell activation (i.e. urticaria, flushing, generalized pruritis, bronchospasm, throat tightness, and/or hypotension)
Previous episodes of angioedema
Family h/o similar cutaneous or laryngeal symptoms, or recurrent abdominal pain.
Tests recommended by Allergy:
CBC w/ Diff
C4 Complement
Clinical Pearls:
Angioedema is localized swelling of skin or mucosal membranes (upper respiratory or GI tracts) due to loss of vascular integrity and is subdivided into three categories:
Histamine mediated : allergic reactions and reactions to NSAIDs, usually associated with urticaria and/or pruritis
Bradykinin-mediated generation: induced by ACE-I, hereditary angioedema and acquired C1 inhibitor (C1NH) deficiency
Unknown/idiopathic}
My Clinical Question (condition: Asthma): ***
My most current assessment of this problem can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
{INFORMATIONAL:PRESS F2 and DELETE KEY before signing
In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:
Duration of symptoms
Medications tried/on, level of control achieved
Frequency of exacerbations
Number of oral steroid courses in the last 12 months
Number of ED/ urgent care visits for asthma exacerbations in the last 12 months
Tests recommended by Allergy:
PFT’s
Clinical Pearls:
Assess inhaler technique (and advise use of spacer if applicable) and compliance first if meds are ineffective.}
My Clinical Question (condition: Chronic Urticaria/Hives): ***
My most current assessment of this problem can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
{INFORMATIONAL:PRESS F2 and DELETE KEY before signing
In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:
Use of H1 and H2 receptor antagonists
Names, durations and doses
Tests recommended by Allergy:
None
Clinical Pearls:
Chronic hives are defined as pruritic lesions occurring for greater than 6 weeks, typically with central raised “wheal” and surrounding erythema, “flare”. There is a variant that can appear more as a papular lesion. If rash differs from this description, consider referral to dermatology.
Consider a trial of long acting H1-receptor antagonist (fexofenadine, or cetirizine) twice daily. Patients should take a picture of the lesions in the event a future visit is needed.}

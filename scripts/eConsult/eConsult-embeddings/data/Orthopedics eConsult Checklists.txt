My Clinical Question (condition: Back/Hip pain): ***
My most current assessment of this problem can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
{INFORMATIONAL:PRESS F2 and DELETE KEY before signing
In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:
Precipitating injury
Duration of symptoms
Location of pain (midline, laterality, radiation)
Change in function
Weakness on exam
Previous treatment (PT, injection, bracing, etc.)
Imaging studies
Most recent BMI
Imaging recommendations by orthopedics:
Clinicians should not routinely obtain imaging in patients with nonspecific, atraumatic back pain, instead, reserve imaging for patients with severe or progressive neurologic deficits or when serious underlying conditions are suspected on the basis of history and physical examination.
Clinical Pearls:
Red Flag symptoms, which, if present or suspected, represent an indication for earlier imaging include:
Neurologic deficits – *immediate MRI and urgent in-person referral for concerns of spinal cord or cauda equina compression and/or severe neurologic deficits*
Infection
Cancer (patients with cancer or risk factors)
Compression fracture
Stable radiculopathy attributable to a single nerve root level or with stable symptoms due to spinal stenosis so not need immediate imaging unless there is a risk of metastatic cancer or moderate to high risk of infection. }
My Clinical Question (condition: Hand/Wrist pain): ***
My most current assessment of this problem can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
{INFORMATIONAL:PRESS F2 and DELETE KEY before signing
In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:
Hand dominance
Precipitating injury/trauma, occupational activities, change in function
Localization and timing of pain
Joint swelling/effusion
Neurovascular assessment
Previous treatment (PT, injection, bracing, etc.)
Imaging studies
Imaging guidance by orthopedics:
X-ray of the hand is generally indicated in patient with joint pain and inflammation, a history of trauma, or the presence of a deformity:
X-ray Hand
Standard plain radiographs of the wrist is often necessary to make a definitive diagnosis:
X-ray Wrist
Clinical Pearls:
If pain is associated with any systemic symptoms (eg fever, nightsweats) or occurs in both hands/wrists or in other joints in addition, consider systemic illness and more urgent evaluation.}
My Clinical Question (condition: Knee pain): ***
My most current assessment of this problem can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
{INFORMATIONAL:PRESS F2 and DELETE KEY before signing
In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:
Precipitating injury
Duration of symptoms
Location of pain (anterior, medial, lateral, posterior)
Change in function
Effusion
Previous treatment (PT, injection, bracing, etc.)
Imaging studies
Most recent BMI
Imaging guidance by orthopedics:
If the patient is greater than 50 years of age with knee pain, consider obtaining the following X-rays:
X-ray Knee 3 Views (When placing these orders, in the comments field, ass the following to ensure the correct views are obtained: “AP bilateral standing (weightbearing), Lateral and Sunrise”)
If X-rays demonstrate signs of arthritis (significant joint space narrowing), an MRI is typically not helpful for initial evaluation.
If arthritis is NOT suspected (the patient is less than 45 years of age ) and the patient has an acute injury:
X-rays are NOT required
An MRI may be helpful: MRI Knee w/o Contrast
Acute pain and symptoms including locking, catching/mechanical symptoms, effusion, and instability benefit from an MRI
Clinical Pearls:
None}
My Clinical Question (condition: Neck pain): ***
My most current assessment of this problem can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
{INFORMATIONAL:PRESS F2 and DELETE KEY before signing
In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:

Previous treatment (PT, injection, bracing, etc.)
Imaging studies
Imaging recommendations by orthopedics:
Clinicians should not routinely obtain imaging in patients with nonspecific, atraumatic neck or back pain, instead, reserve imaging for patients with severe or progressive neurologic deficits or when serious underlying conditions are suspected on the basis of history and physical examination.
Consider cervical spine X-rays for persistent (>6 weeks), moderate to severe neck pain without red flags and affecting sleep or ability to perform daily activities and/or occupation.
Clinical Pearls:
Red Flag symptoms, which, if present or suspected, represent an indication for earlier imaging include:
Neurologic deficits – **immediate MRI and urgent in-person referral for concerns of spinal cord or cauda equina compression and/or severe neurologic deficits**
Infection
Cancer (patients with cancer or risk factors)
Compression fracture
Stable radiculopathy attributable to a single nerve root level or with stable symptoms due to spinal stenosis so not need immediate imaging unless there is a risk of metastatic cancer or moderate to high risk of infection. }
My Clinical Question (condition: Shoulder pain): ***
My most current assessment of this problem can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
{INFORMATIONAL:PRESS F2 and DELETE KEY before signing
In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:
Precipitating injury
Duration of symptoms
Location of pain
Loss of passive range of motion
Change in function
Weakness on exam
Previous treatment (PT, injection, bracing, etc.)
Imaging studies
Tests recommended by orthopedics for SHOULDER PAIN:
If arthritis is suspected, the patient is greater than 50 years of age, and has deep pain and/or stiffness, consider obtaining:
X-ray shoulder >= 2 Views (When placing these orders, add the following in the comments field to ensure the correct views are obtained: “True PA, AP and Internal Rotation, Axillary, Scapular Y”).
Clinical Pearls:
Frozen Shoulder is defined as: Loss of passive range of motion, and in the early phase, there is associated rest pain. If the patient is greater than 60 years of age, consider obtaining x-rays (“True Neer AP & Westpoint Axillary”). If the patient has frozen shoulder, do not obtain an MRI.

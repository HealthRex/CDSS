In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:
Onset, duration and timing of symptoms
Co-morbid conditions (anxiety, depression, insomnia, substance use include tobacco and caffeine, OSA, hyper/hypothyroidism)
Any prior neuropsychiatric testing in childhood/adulthood
Any current psychiatric medications or medications that impact the nervous system
Any current psychiatric providers/therapists?
Tests recommended by psychiatry:
CBC, Serum Iron, Serum Ferritin, Iron/TIBC with Saturation, B12, TSH w/reflex T4
Clinical Pearls:
ADHD manifests in childhood and leads to difficulties in multiple settings (school/work/home). If adult onset of symptoms, please consider secondary causes such as sleep disorders, substance abuse, trauma, traumatic brain injury, depression and/or anxiety.
If previous testing, recommend obtaining documentation of diagnosis (neuropsychiatric testing, physician diagnosis, school/work performance reports, etc).
If other comorbidities, consider treating and/or optimizing treatment of comorbid conditions before treating ADHD.}

{INFORMATIONAL:PRESS F2 and DELETE KEY before signing

Onset, duration and timing of symptoms
Co-morbid conditions (insomnia, substance use include tobacco and caffeine, OSA, hyper/hypothyroidism, neurological disorders, chronic pain, diabetes mellitus, HF)

Any current psychiatric providers/therapists?
Tests recommended by psychiatry:
Screening: GAD7, PHQ9
Labs: CBC, Serum Iron, Serum Ferritin, Iron/TIBC with Saturation, vit B12, vit D folate, TSH w/reflex T4
Clinical Pearls:
For mild-to-moderate anxiety (GAD 5-15), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is better than medications
For moderate-to-severe anxiety (GAD >15), CBT and medications are more effective than medications alone
Start a low dose SSRI or SNRI, start bupropion for depression if patient has less anxiety and is concerned about sexual/weight side effects or has more fatigue/concentration symptoms
6-8 week SSRI trial needed to determine effectiveness
50% of patients who do not respond to the initial SSRI will respond to another
Before using a benzodiazepine because of potential dependency, consider starting hydroxyzine 25mg every 4-6 hours as needed. Also consider PRN gabapentin}

CBC, CMP, TSH with reflex to T4
Clinical Pearls:
Patients on lithium should have regular thyroid screening as well as monitoring of kidney function
Patients on depakote should have regular LFT monitoring as well as CBC monitoring (can cause thrombocytopenia)
Depakote, carbemazapine, and lamotrigine all interact with OCPs and are also associated with neural tube defects in pregnancy, special caution when using these in women on OCPs or planning pregnancy}

Substances used

Desire to have substance use addressed
Co-morbid psychiatric conditions
Tests recommended by psychiatry:
Urine Toxicology, CMP, Hep B/C + HIV if using IV drugs
Recommend TAPs to screen generally for substances, AUDIT C for alcohol use
Clinical Pearls:
Co-morbid mood/anxiety disorders should be addressed concurrently to substance use
Patients chronically overusing alcohol should be encouraged to take daily thiamine supplement  of at least 100mg at a separate time from their typical alcohol use
SMART recovery is a good alternative group that uses CBT/mindfulness skills to address recovery if patients are not interested in AA/NA groups
SAMHSA has a treatment finder function as well as self-help group function

{INFORMATIONAL:PRESS F2 and DELETE KEY before signing
In your clinical question, or note, please include information on:
Current psychiatric diagnosis
Current and past medications, which were effective, duration of trial
Are there specific side-effects the patient is concerned about
Relevant co-morbid conditions (insomnia, substance use include tobacco and caffeine, OSA, hyper/hypothyroidism, neurological disorders)
Tests recommended by psychiatry:
Screenings: PHQ9/GAD7
CBC, TSH, CMP, vitamin D, vitamin B12, folate if applicable
Clinical Pearls:
Many psychiatric medications have several CYP interactions â€“ would recommend running a medication interaction check if your patient is on several medical medications as well as psychiatric medications
Would not recommend duloxetine use in patients with CrCl <60
Duloxetine and low-dose TCAs such as amytriptyline/nortryptline and desipramine may be useful for co-management of mood and functional disorders such as CFS, fibromyalgia, IBS
Venlafaxine and paroxetine have more intolerable withdrawal if stopped abruptly than other SSRIs/SNRIs}

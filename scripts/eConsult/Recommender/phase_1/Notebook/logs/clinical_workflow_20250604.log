    Clinical Notes: 52‑year‑old female with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate and low‑dose prednisone presents with 6‑week history of daily fevers up to 102°F, drenching night sweats, and a 12‑lb unintentional weight loss. Initial blood cultures and chest X‑ray were unrevealing. She denies cough, dyspnea, or focal pain. Lab results show mild anemia (Hgb 11.2), elevated ESR (85 mm/hr), and CRP (12 mg/dL). CT chest/abdomen reveals multiple small pulmonary nodules and hepatosplenic lesions. Concern for disseminated non‑tuberculous mycobacteria vs. histoplasmosis. Input on biopsy site selection and empiric therapy is requested.

    Clinical Question: In a patient with persistent fever, night sweats, and weight loss despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, could this represent disseminated mycobacterial infection or an atypical fungal process, and what diagnostic workup is indicated?
    Clinical Notes: 52‑year‑old female with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate and low‑dose prednisone presents with 6‑week history of daily fevers up to 102°F, drenching night sweats, and a 12‑lb unintentional weight loss. Initial blood cultures and chest X‑ray were unrevealing. She denies cough, dyspnea, or focal pain. Lab results show mild anemia (Hgb 11.2), elevated ESR (85 mm/hr), and CRP (12 mg/dL). CT chest/abdomen reveals multiple small pulmonary nodules and hepatosplenic lesions. Concern for disseminated non‑tuberculous mycobacteria vs. histoplasmosis. Input on biopsy site selection and empiric therapy is requested.

    Clinical Question: In a patient with persistent fever, night sweats, and weight loss despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, could this represent disseminated mycobacterial infection or an atypical fungal process, and what diagnostic workup is indicated?
    Clinical Notes: 52‑year‑old female with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate and low‑dose prednisone presents with 6‑week history of daily fevers up to 102°F, drenching night sweats, and a 12‑lb unintentional weight loss. Initial blood cultures and chest X‑ray were unrevealing. She denies cough, dyspnea, or focal pain. Lab results show mild anemia (Hgb 11.2), elevated ESR (85 mm/hr), and CRP (12 mg/dL). CT chest/abdomen reveals multiple small pulmonary nodules and hepatosplenic lesions. Concern for disseminated non‑tuberculous mycobacteria vs. histoplasmosis. Input on biopsy site selection and empiric therapy is requested.

    Rationale: The patient's presentation of persistent fevers, night sweats, weight loss, multiple pulmonary nodules, and hepatosplenic lesions despite broad-spectrum antibiotics is highly suggestive of a disseminated opportunistic infection, a hallmark of immunosuppression. The ICD-10 code B20 is for HIV disease resulting in infectious and parasitic diseases, which best matches the scenario involving suspicion for disseminated mycobacterial or fungal infection in an immunocompromised patient. Although HIV is not stated, B20 is used in ICD-10 to broadly capture serious opportunistic infectious conditions in immunocompromised individuals; the other codes do not match this setting.

    Clinical Question: In a patient with persistent fever, night sweats, and weight loss despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, could this represent disseminated mycobacterial infection or an atypical fungal process, and what diagnostic workup is indicated?
    Clinical Notes: 52‑year‑old female with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate and low‑dose prednisone presents with 6‑week history of daily fevers up to 102°F, drenching night sweats, and a 12‑lb unintentional weight loss.

    Rationale: The patient's immunosuppression (due to methotrexate and prednisone) and presentation with prolonged fever, night sweats, weight loss, and possible disseminated infection with atypical mycobacteria or fungi fit the context of an opportunistic infection often seen in immunocompromised states. Among the available codes, B20 (Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] disease) is the only infectious disease code related to immunosuppression and opportunistic infections, which most closely matches the scenario involving concern for disseminated infections in the immunocompromised host.

    Clinical Question: In a patient with persistent fever, night sweats, and weight loss despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, could this represent disseminated mycobacterial infection or an atypical fungal process, and what diagnostic workup is indicated?
    Clinical Notes: 52‑year‑old female with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate and low‑dose prednisone presents with 6‑week history of daily fevers up to 102°F, drenching night sweats, and a 12‑lb unintentional weight loss.

    ICD-10 Code: Z79.4
    Rationale: Z79.4 indicates long term (current) use of immunosuppressive drugs, which is highly relevant as the patient's immunosuppression (methotrexate and prednisone) is central to her risk for disseminated infections such as mycobacterial or fungal disease. None of the other codes capture the clinical problem more appropriately.

    Clinical Question: In a patient with persistent fever, night sweats, and weight loss despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, could this represent disseminated mycobacterial infection or an atypical fungal process, and what diagnostic workup is indicated?
    Clinical Notes: 52‑year‑old female with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate and low‑dose prednisone presents with 6‑week history of daily fevers up to 102°F, drenching night sweats, and a 12‑lb unintentional weight loss. Initial blood cultures and chest X‑ray were unrevealing. She denies cough, dyspnea, or focal pain. Lab results show mild anemia (Hgb 11.2), elevated ESR (85 mm/hr), and CRP (12 mg/dL). CT chest/abdomen reveals multiple small pulmonary nodules and hepatosplenic lesions. Concern for disseminated non‑tuberculous mycobacteria vs. histoplasmosis.

    Rationale: The patient's presentation is consistent with an opportunistic infection (such as disseminated mycobacterial or fungal infection) in the setting of immunosuppression. Of the provided codes, B20 (HIV disease resulting in infectious and parasitic diseases) is the closest code for immunodeficiency with infection, as there is no more precise code for disseminated mycobacterial or fungal disease on this list. The other codes do not relate to immunosuppression or infection.

    Clinical Question: In a patient with persistent fever, night sweats, and weight loss despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, could this represent disseminated mycobacterial infection or an atypical fungal process, and what diagnostic workup is indicated?
    Clinical Notes: 52‑year‑old female with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate and low‑dose prednisone presents with 6‑week history of daily fevers up to 102°F, drenching night sweats, and a 12‑lb unintentional weight loss. Initial blood cultures and chest X‑ray were unrevealing. She denies cough, dyspnea, or focal pain. Lab results show mild anemia (Hgb 11.2), elevated ESR (85 mm/hr), and CRP (12 mg/dL).

CT chest/abdomen reveals multiple small pulmonary nodules and hepatosplenic lesions. Concern for disseminated non‑tuberculous mycobacteria vs. histoplasmosis. Input on biopsy site selection and empiric therapy is requested.

    Rationale: The clinical scenario describes a patient with immunosuppression (methotrexate and prednisone for rheumatoid arthritis) and symptoms/signs compatible with a severe, opportunistic infection (fevers, night sweats, weight loss, hepatosplenic and pulmonary involvement). Among the provided codes, B20 represents 'Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] disease,' which is the ICD-10 category that best fits disseminated opportunistic infections. While the patient is not known to have HIV, none of the other codes are applicable to disseminated mycobacterial or fungal diseases, so B20 is the closest match given the severe immunosuppression and clinical suspicion.

    Clinical Question: In a patient with persistent fever, night sweats, and weight loss despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, could this represent disseminated mycobacterial infection or an atypical fungal process, and what diagnostic workup is indicated?
    Clinical Notes: 52‑year‑old female with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate and low‑dose prednisone presents with 6‑week history of daily fevers up to 102°F, drenching night sweats, and a 12‑lb unintentional weight loss. Initial blood cultures and chest X‑ray were unrevealing. She denies cough, dyspnea, or focal pain. Lab results show mild anemia (Hgb 11.2), elevated ESR (85 mm/hr), and CRP (12 mg/dL).

Initial blood cultures and chest X‑ray were unrevealing. She denies cough, dyspnea, or focal pain. Lab results show mild anemia (Hgb 11.2), elevated ESR (85 mm/hr), and CRP (12 mg/dL). CT chest/abdomen reveals multiple small pulmonary nodules and hepatosplenic lesions. Concern for disseminated non‑tuberculous mycobacteria vs. histoplasmosis. Input on biopsy site selection and empiric therapy is requested.

    Clinical Question: In a patient with persistent fever, night sweats, and weight loss despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, could this represent disseminated mycobacterial infection or an atypical fungal process, and what diagnostic workup is indicated?
    Clinical Notes: 52‑year‑old female with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate and low‑dose prednisone presents with 6‑week history of daily fevers up to 102°F, drenching night sweats, and a 12‑lb unintentional weight loss. Initial blood cultures and chest X‑ray were unrevealing. She denies cough, dyspnea, or focal pain. Lab results show mild anemia (Hgb 11.2), elevated ESR (85 mm/hr), and CRP (12 mg/dL). CT chest/abdomen reveals multiple small pulmonary nodules and hepatosplenic lesions. Concern for disseminated non‑tuberculous mycobacteria vs. histoplasmosis.

    Current Match:
    ICD-10 Code: B20
    Rationale: The patient's presentation with persistent fever, night sweats, weight loss, multiple small pulmonary nodules, and hepatosplenic lesions on immunosuppression raises concern for an opportunistic infection. B20 (HIV disease) is the only infectious disease code provided and is used for immunosuppression-related infections not otherwise specified by other codes in this list. While she is not documented as HIV-positive, none of the other available codes represent mycobacterial or fungal infections; hence, B20 most closely matches the clinical scenario of immunosuppression and opportunistic infection risk.

    Clinical Question: In a patient with persistent fever, night sweats, and weight loss despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, could this represent disseminated mycobacterial infection or an atypical fungal process, and what diagnostic workup is indicated?
    Clinical Notes: 52‑year‑old female with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate and low‑dose prednisone presents with 6‑week history of daily fevers up to 102°F, drenching night sweats, and a 12‑lb unintentional weight loss. Initial blood cultures and chest X‑ray were unrevealing. She denies cough, dyspnea, or focal pain. Lab results show mild anemia (Hgb 11.2), elevated ESR (85 mm/hr), and CRP (12 mg/dL). CT chest/abdomen reveals multiple small pulmonary nodules and hepatosplenic lesions. Concern for disseminated non‑tuberculous mycobacteria vs. histoplasmosis. Input on biopsy site selection and empiric therapy is requested.

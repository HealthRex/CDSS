My Clinical Question (inflammatory back pain): ***
My most current assessment of this problem can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
{INFORMATIONAL:PRESS F2 and DELETE KEY before signing
SPECIAL NOTE: Please do NOT order an eConsult for fibromyalgia. This should instead be referred.
In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:
ASSESSMENTS:
Required:
None
Optional:
Age at which back pain developed
Whether back pain worsens with activity or with rest? Whether it wakes patient up from sleep in the second half of the night and/or is associated with AM stiffness? Length of AM stiffness?
Prior medical history of inflammatory eye disease, psoriasis or IBD?
Medications tried
DIAGNOSTICS:
Required:
CBC with diff
CMP
ESR
CRP
HLA-B27
X-ray of affected area of spine (if applicable)
X-ray SI joints (if applicable)
Optional:
None
CLINICAL PEARLS:
Patients who develop back pain > 45 years of age are unlikely to have an axial spondyloarthropathy.

{INFORMATIONAL:PRESS F2 and DELETE KEY before signing
SPECIAL NOTE: Please do NOT order an eConsult for fibromyalgia. This should instead be referred.
In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:
ASSESSMENTS:
Required:
None
Optional:
At what age did the attacks of inflammatory arthritis begin?
Which joints are affected?
Does the patient have any of the following signs or symptoms:
Recurrent acute attacks of joint pain? (# of flares in a year and/or # months)
Radiographic erosions consistent with gout?
Tophi?
Sodium urate crystals in joint aspirate?
Does the patient have a history of renal stones?
Please describe current and past treatments. If pt experienced complications with conventional therapy for gout, please describe.
Has the patient had a uric acid level > 6?
DIAGNOSTICS:
Required:
Serum Uric Acid
CBC w diff
CMP
X-ray of affected joint(s)
Optional:
None
CLINICAL PEARLS:
An elevated serum uric acid is not diagnostic of gout. Preferentially, diagnosis should be confirmed by joint aspiration and fluid examination for crystals.
In patients with monoarthritis, especially in association with fever and immunocompromised, urgent evaluation may be required to rule out septic arthritis
The goal for urate lowering therapy should be a uric acid level less than 6.0 mg/dl in non-tophaceous gout and less than 5.0 mg/dL in patients with tophaceous gout
Consider excessive EtOH or stopping diuretics

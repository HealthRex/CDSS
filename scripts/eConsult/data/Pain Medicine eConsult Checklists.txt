Clinical pearls:
Classical pain syndromes include:

Trigeminal neuralgia type 2: Constant facial pain with spontaneous flares of worsening pain.
Trigeminal neuropathic pain: Injury to the peripheral nerves of the trigeminal system (e.g. history of ENT surgery, dental work, skull base surgery, stroke); associated with sensitivty to the overlying tissue (skin, teeth); can see numbness/tingling in the affected area as well.
Trigeminal neuralgia is typically random whereas trigeminal neuropathy can be reproduced by manipulating the painful area.}

My most current assessment of this problem can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
{INFORMATIONAL:PRESS F2 and DELETE KEY before signing
In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:

Fibromyalgia diagnosis incorporates both widespread muscle pain and associated cognitive symptoms (fatigue, depression, mental fogginess, sleep disruption).
Consistent moderate exercise (walking, yoga, warm aquatic therapy, etc) for 15-30 minutes 3 times a week can improve both the widespread pain and mood/sleep/cognitive symptoms of fibromyalgia.
Myofascial pain typically involves point tenderness in a muscle belly, but can also be associated with a variety of referred pain patterns due to terminal nerve branches getting trapped in the tense muscle; less associated with cognitive symptoms
Common treatments for myofascial pain include PT, trigger point injections, dry needling, integrative medicine, and massage.}

Opioid Tapering
My Clinical Question (condition: opioid tapering): ***
(Please ask your question for opioid tapering for CHRONIC PAIN. Opioid tapering for addiction and patients who are being treated for addiction are generally not appropriate for Pain Medicine – consider referrals to Addiction Medicine Dual Diagnosis/Psychiatry or Chemical Dependency.)
My most current assessment of this problem can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
{INFORMATIONAL:PRESS F2 and DELETE KEY before signing
In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:

Suspected/known other substance use disorders? Psychiatric diagnoses?
Medical comorbidities?
Family history of SUD?
COWS Score (https://www.drugabuse.gov/sites/default/files/files/ClinicalOpiateWithdrawalScale.pdf)
Tests recommended by pain medicine:
Pain management confirmation 4 profile (urine)
Blood Alcohol Level
CMP
CBC
EKG
Clinical pearls:
A significant number of patients report feeling better as they reduce their opioid intake.
An opioid taper doesn't have to mean cessation of opioids altogether if they are otherwise appropriate for the patient and their condition.
The pain clinic can assist in opioid tapering, but we do not typically take over long term opioid prescriptions.  Once the patient has been weaned as much as possible, the referring provider is expected to resume the long term prescription.}
Pain Psychology
My Clinical Question (condition: pain psychology): ***
(An eConsult can be used to establish your patient with Pain Psychology services only and directly. This is a good alternative to an in-person referral to establish with Pain Management Center for comprehensive evaluation and multidisciplinary treatment.)
My most current assessment of this problem can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
{INFORMATIONAL:PRESS F2 and DELETE KEY before signing
In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:
Brief pain history?
Any prior and current medications, treatments, interventions/procedures, or surgeries to treat this pain? If so, when and what was the result (better, worse, no different, allergy/side effect)?
Pertinent comorbidities?
Tests recommended by pain medicine:
Relevant imaging
Clinical pearls:
Insurance can be a significant barrier to accessing psychology services.  It may be helpful to review the patient's coverage before referral.
MediCal has their own mental health service and as such does not pay for Stanford Psychology.
Some Stanford Psychology services can be provided with reduced out of pocket cost by eliminating psychological testing. }
Persistent Post-op Pain
My Clinical Question (condition: persistent post-op pain): ***
My most current assessment of this problem can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
{INFORMATIONAL:PRESS F2 and DELETE KEY before signing
In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:
Inciting event? Quality? Timing? Location? Alleviating/aggravating factors?

Any prior and current medications, treatments, interventions/procedures, or surgeries to treat this pain? If so, when and what was the result (better, worse, no different, allergy/side effect)?
Pertinent comorbidities?
Surgical procedure(s) associated with pt’s pain? Dates?
Tests recommended by pain medicine:
Relevant imaging
Clinical pearls:
Pre-procedure pain often predicts post-procedure pain.
Having a pain management plan going into the procedure can be beneficial.
Persistent post operative pain often has significant neuropathic component and therefore can respond well to anti-neuropathic treatments.}

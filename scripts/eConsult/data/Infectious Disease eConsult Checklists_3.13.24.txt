Detailed information about PrEP for clinicians can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/clinicians/prevention/prep.html for details regarding PrEP
Assuming PrEP is indicated for your patient and your patient is interested in pursuing this intervention after discussing risks and benefits, the following steps should be undertaken:
Obtain a negative HIV test within the week before initiation PrEP.
Ensure the patient does not currently have signs or symptoms that could be consistent with acute HIV infection in which case additional testing may be needed.
Ensure stable renal function and lack of infection with HBV and HCV with chemistries, HBsAg, and HCV serologies.
Screen for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. MSM should be tested by collecting pharyngeal, rectal, and urine specimens.
Educate the patient about medications, HIV risk-reduction behaviors, and contraception (if relevant).
Patients on PrEP should be seen at least very 3 months for repeat HIV testing and clinical assessment for possible acute HIV infection; pregnancy tests (for women who may become pregnant); refill for a maximum of 90 days; assessment of and counseling on side effects, adherence, and HIV risk behaviors; and STI screening for asymptomatic MSM at high risk for bacterial STIs.
Every 6 months monitor creatinine and conduct STI screening for sexually active individuals.
Every 12 months evaluate need to continue PrEP.}

My most current assessment of this problem can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
{INFORMATIONAL:PRESS F2 and DELETE KEY before signing
In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:
ASSESSMENTS:
Required:
Please describe current and past antiviral treatment and/or prophylaxis (including dosing, duration and response).
What signs or symptoms does the patient have?
DIAGNOSTICS:
Optional:
HSV 1 and HSV 2 IgG
HSV DNA PCR Qual (Lesion)
Viral Culture
CLINICAL PEARLS:
If there is uncertainty as to the diagnosis of herpes simplex, diagnostic tests can be pursued for clarification:
Ulcerative lesions can be swabbed with a polyester-, rayon- or nylon-tipped flocked swab and placed in viral transport medium. (Do not use calcium alginate swabs, cotton swabs, or wooden-shafted swabs).
HSV 1 and HSV 2 IgG antibodies can diagnose presence of infection if ulcerative lesions are not actively present. There is no established role for HSV IgM tests.
Recurrent (subsequent) episodes of herpes simplex in non-immunocompromised patients can be treated with these regimens:
Genital herpes: valacyclovir (Valtrex) 1 g daily for 5 days or 500 mg twice daily for 3 days.
Oral herpes: valacyclovir (Valtrex) 2 g twice daily for 1 day.
Famciclovir and acyclovir are alternatives though regimens differ from those above.
Chronic suppression for those with frequent oral or genital herpes simplex episodes can be accomplished with:
Acyclovir 400 mg twice daily
Valacyclovir (Valtrex) 500 mg to 1 g daily}

{INFORMATIONAL:PRESS F2 and DELETE KEY before signing
ASSESSMENTS:
Required:
If relevant, what prior vaccinations did the patient receive?
Has the patient had any adverse reactions to past vaccinations?
Does the patient have any co-morbidities?
Is the patient immunocompromised?
Optional:
Relevant Serologies
DIAGNOSTICS:
None
CLINICAL PEARLS:
An updated adult vaccine schedule can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/adult.html .
Vaccines have minimum intervals between doses (which can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/a/age-interval-table.pdf) but no maximum intervals. There is no need to restart a series due to delayed administration of a vaccine in a series (except in some cases related to the oral typhoid vaccine)
Live-attenuated vaccines (MMR and VAR) can be given the same day but if not given the same day, they should be separated by at least 4 weeks.
Multiple vaccines can be given at the same visit, with 2 notable exceptions:
PCV13 and PPSV23 should not be given together and need to be spaced apart.
PCV13 and Menactra (not on formulary at Stanford Health Care) should not be given together to asplenic patients. Menveo (on formulary at Stanford Health Care) can be given at the same visit as PCV13.
Vaccine contraindications and precautions can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/contraindications.html .
Vaccines supplied in vials or syringes containing latex can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/latex-table.pdf
Administration of blood products and immunoglobulins can reduce the effectiveness of MMR and VAR. Specific recommendations on this topic can be found in Table 2-04 of http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/the-pre-travel-consultation/general-recommendations-for-vaccination-immunoprophylaxis .
In general, patient self-reporting of vaccination history should not be accepted as valid. If documentation of a vaccine is not available, the individual should be assumed to be unvaccinated for that dose. (An exception is that patient self-report can be accepted as valid for influenza and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines).}

My Clinical Question (condition: Latent Tuberculosis (TB)): ***
My most current assessment of this problem can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
{INFORMATIONAL:PRESS F2 and DELETE KEY before signing
In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:
ASSESSMENTS:
Required:
Prior history of TB or latent TB or prior treatment with antimycobacterial medications
Signs or symptoms which could be consistent with pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB:
Cough
Fever
Night sweats
Weigh loss Anorexia
Other
When was the last PPD? Include date, measurement in mm and reading (pos/neg)
Risk factors for TB reactivation (immunocompromising conditions, ESRD, low body weight, diabetes mellitus, intestinal bypass or gastrectomy, etc)
Risk factors for TB infection (birth in endemic country, known TB contact, etc)
Any abnormal imaging which could be consistent with extrapulmonary TB
DIAGNOSTICS:
Required:
Chest imaging/results
Most recent HIV test
Optional:
QuantiFERON (Interferon-Gamma Release Assays)(IGRAs)
T-SPOT. TB Test (Interferon Gamma Release Assay/IGRA)
PPD
CLINICAL PEARLS:
Tests for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) include the tuberculin skin test and the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). The MTB IGRA test used at this institution is the QuantiFERON-TB Plus test.
Further information about LTBI testing and treatment can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/ltbi/default.htm .
Like all laboratory tests, the QuantiFERON-TB Plus test is subject to false-positive results. For this reason, some experts recommend further evaluation of patients without significant epidemiologic risk factors for MTB infection with low QuantiFERON-TB Plus Ag-Nil results (for example, less than 0.7 IU/mL).
MTB IGRA tests cannot differentiate LTBI from active TB. Therefore, any patient with a positive MTB IGRA result needs evaluation to determine whether they may have active TB (pulmonary or extrapulmonary) before considering treatment for LTBI. This evaluation includes radiographic evaluation (a chest X-ray) and clinical evaluation (history and examination). If there are abnormalities on either chest X-ray or on history or exam that may be consistent with TB, further evaluation (such as sputum cultures) is needed. For example, a patient with a positive MTB IGRA and a chronic cough needs sputum cultures obtained to rule out active TB before considering treatment for LTBI even if this patient has a normal chest X-ray.
Treatment regimens for LTBI can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/treatment/ltbi.htm . Four months of daily rifampin is a regimen preferred by many experts for patients without drug interactions or other contraindications to rifampin use.
All patients diagnosed with LTBI or TB disease should be screened for HIV infection with an HIV test.
Baseline liver tests or other laboratory tests are not routinely indicated, except in select individuals such as those on potentially hepatotoxic medications, those who regularly consume alcohol, or those with underlying liver disease.
Patients undergoing treatment for LTBI should be evaluated every 1-2 months to assess adherence and evaluate for signs or symptoms of toxicity. Only select patients should undergo routine laboratory monitoring.}

In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:
ASSESSMENTS:
Required:
Reason patient was tested (signs, symptoms, or exam findings that prompted test, such as rash consistent with erythema migrans, arthralgia, fever, or headache)
Recent travel and/or tick exposure
Treatments
DIAGNOSTICS:
Required:
•	Lyme titers
Lyme Western Blots (Only required if Total Lyme titer or Lyme IgG and IgM titers are positive or equivocal)
CLINICAL PEARLS:
Updated information for healthcare providers about diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/healthcare/index.html
Post-exposure prophylaxis with doxycycline after a tick bite is NOT recommended in California because of low incidence of Lyme disease here
Lyme disease is generally uncommon in California
Do not perform serologic testing as a “test of cure”
Stages of infection
Localized (early) stage (within 3-30 days of exposure):
Characterized by erythema migrans (expanding erythematous rash), flu-like symptoms, and lymphadenopathy
Serologies are insensitive; diagnosis is typically made clinically
Treatment typically involves doxycycline, cefuroxime axetil, or amoxicillin, each typically given for 14 days
Disseminated stage
Characterized by multiple secondary annular rashes, flu-like symptoms, and lymphadenopathy
Other manifestations include migratory arthritis, cardiac conduction abnormalities, myocarditis or pericarditis, Bell’s palsy or cranial neuropathy, meningitis, and radiculopathy or neuropathy
Two-stage testing is appropriate in this stage and can be ordered in Epic as “Lyme Disease Ab IgG IgM w/Rflx”
Patients with disseminated Lyme disease should be referred to ID clinic}

Potential risk factors (chronic catheterization, anatomic abnormalities, implanted devices/stents in the urinary tract)
Antibiotic treatment (dates, antimicrobial agents, and treatment duration)
Does the patient have any allergies (i.e. sulfa drugs, penicillin, other antibiotics, etc)?

Is the patient immunocompromised?
DIAGNOSTICS:
Required:
•	Urinalysis with Microscopy
Urine Culture
Optional:
CBC
Basic Metabolic Panel
Comprehensive Metabolic Panel
CLINICAL PEARLS:
Before diagnosing a patient with recurrent UTIs, ensure the patient is not having asymptomatic bacteriuria (bacteriuria with or without pyuria absent signs or symptoms of a UTI)
Additional investigations for recurrent uncomplicated UTIs in women (such as imaging, cystoscopy, or urodynamics) should be considered for select patients in whom there exists suspicion of complicating factors
Management options for recurrent uncomplicated UTIs in women include:
Episodic antibiotic treatment
Post-coital antibiotics or low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis (typically for 3-12 months), typically with one of these agents
Nitrofurantoin
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
Trimethoprim
Cephalexin
Cefaclor
Fosfomycin
Vaginal estrogen in post-menopausal women
Several approaches to prophylaxis have limited or conflicting evidence and are therefore controversial, though some providers recommend them as they are generally benign; these interventions include cranberry formulations, probiotics, D-mannose, methenamine, and behavioral counseling (increasing fluid intake, wiping from front to back, and others)}

CLINICAL PEARLS:
Presence of anti-HBc antibodies (total) without HBsAg generally indicates resolved HBV infection and is generally of no clinical significance except in the setting of iatrogenic immunosuppression in which case HBV can sometimes reactivate.
Infectious mononucleosis due to EBV does not recur. EBV serologies (heterophile antibodies or EBV-specific serologies) can be used to diagnose EBV-associated infectious mononucleosis in the setting of a compatible clinical syndrome. Nearly all adults have chronic EBV infection, which is of no clinical significance except to the extent that it can be associated with lymphoma and other lymphoproliferative disorders.}

{INFORMATIONAL:PRESS F2 and DELETE KEY before signing
In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:
ASSESSMENTS:
Required:
Signs or symptoms potentially consistent with syphilis and/or neurosyphilis
Sexual exposure history/risk
Please describe past and current treatment.
DIAGNOSTICS:
Required:
RPR titer history
CLINICAL PEARLS:
Treponemal tests (Treponemal EIA/ELISA, TP-PA, and FTA-ABS) are specific for syphilis (and more rarely endemic trepanematoses). They generally remain positive for life after initial infection, even with successful treatment, and therefore cannot be used to track treatment response.
Non-treponemal tests (RPR and VDRL) are not specific for syphilis and are occasionally false-positives. They are useful to track serologic response to syphilis treatment.
Labs today typically utilize a “reverse” screening algorithm starting with automated treponemal tests and reflexing to a manual RPR if positive. This testing approach occasionally identifies individuals with confirmed positive treponemal tests with a negative RPR. These individuals, assuming they are asymptomatic, have late latent syphilis and, assuming they have not previously received treatment, should be treated as such.
Appropriate serological response to syphilis treatment is at least a four-fold decline in RPR (that is, a two-fold decrease in dilutions). For example, an appropriate serologic response to treatment would be a decrease in RPR from 1:128 to 1:32. RPR often eventually decreases to the point of seroreversion but a “serofast” state sometimes exists where an RPR stays positive at low levels. Particularly when RPR titers are low at diagnosis (1:1, 1:2, or 1:4), titers may not decline, which does not necessarily reflect treatment failure.}

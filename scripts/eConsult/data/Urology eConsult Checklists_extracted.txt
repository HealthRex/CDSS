Hematospermia, while alarming to patients, is almost always a benign condition and will usually resolve spontaneously.
Most commonly, prostate biopsy causes hematospermia in 80% of men, lasting 3-4 weeks on average.
Persistent unexplained hematospermia (>1 month) should be referred to Urology.}

All patients with gross (visible) or symptomatic microscopic (>3 RBCs per high powered field (HPF) confirmed on a good specimen) hematuria, in absence of a culture positive UTI, should be referred to Urology for evaluation.
All patients with persistent microscopic hematuria with risk factors without clear cause, should be referred to Urology.
Anticoagulated patients with hematuria by the above parameters, should also be referred for evaluation.
Patients with signs of glomerular bleeding (casts, worsening edema, HTN, hypoalbuminemia) should be referred urgently to Nephrology.
Patients with gross hematuria with blood clots or retention symptoms should be sent to the ER urgently.

[Urine culture – if UTI or hematuria suggested]
Clinical pearls:
Please see recommended the algorithm and/or suggested guidelines for management here: https://www.auanet.org//guidelines/overactive-bladder-(oab)-guideline
Medications are a common cause of overactive bladder and urinary incontinence
Pelvic floor physical therapy is recommended first-line therapy for stress and mixed incontinence
Bladder training and assessment/reduction of fluid intake is recommended for urge incontinence
Treatment with medications (e.g. anti-muscarinics) is not recommended for women with stress incontinence alone

Post-coital antibiotic prophylaxis (Ciprofloxacin, Bactrim) is as effective as continuous antibiotic prophylaxis.
Consider imaging with repeated episodes of pyelonephritis
Do not treat asymptomatic bacteriuria (with or without indwelling catheter) with antibiotics. Males with UTI should be referred to Urology for evaluation.}

If the lesion appears to be other than a simple cyst, rec CT w contrast
Clinical Pearls
Further evaluation of < 2 cm small, benign-appearing cysts (Bosniak category 1-2) is not required. Masses or Bosniak category 3-4 cysts should be referred to Urology –
Large kidneys with multiple cysts consistent with PCKD should be referred to nephrology.
With questionable ultrasound findings, consider calling radiology consult line to guide next step/imaging.}

Tests recommended by Urology:
[UA, U Cx, GC/CT – if epididymitis suspected or lower urinary tract symptoms present]
Clinical pearls:
Suspicion of testicular torsion, acute epididymitis and Fournier’s gangrene (all associated with diffuse scrotal pain), warrants urgent medical evaluation or surgical management. Consider sending the patient to the ER.}
My Clinical Question (condition: Void Trials/Catheter Questions): ***
My most current assessment of this problem can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
{INFORMATIONAL:PRESS F2 and DELETE KEY before signing
In your clinical question, or current note, please include information on:
Reason and duration of urinary catheter
Reason for void trial
Previous void trials
What medications is the patient on
Tests recommended by Urology:
Urinalysis
Urine culture
Clinical pearls:
Acute urinary retention (AUR) in men with BPH or presumed BPH is treated with urethral catheterization for bladder decompression. An alpha-1-adrenergic antagonist (eg, alfuzosin 10 mg daily) initiated at the time of initial catheterization. Ongoing combination treatment is generally necessary to prevent recurrence of AUR.
In men with AUR due to BPH, removal of the catheter after a period of time ("trial without catheter" or TWOC) results in successful spontaneous micturition in up to 40 percent of patients, although recurrent AUR is common. We suggest a trial of catheter removal in one to two weeks. For patients who fail the initial TWOC, we advise a second trial of TWOC after an additional two weeks with the catheter.
Men with BPH who fail a second TWOC may need surgical therapy. A urodynamic evaluation is advised prior to prostate surgery for patients who have experienced AUR.}

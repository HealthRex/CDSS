Asthma – Wake Forest template
**Note:  Pulmonology E-CONSULT for ASTHMA is most useful when the patient has symptoms that are refractory to routine controller (or beta-agonist treatment) or has evidence of aspirin sensitivity.
>> Please consider the following:
+ For patients with previous PFTs, include relevant data in the clinical question.
+ For most patients, it is helpful to have PFTs (spirometry, lung volumes, DLCO) within the past 12 months.
+ If patients are refractory to routine therapy, a CBC with differential to examine eosinophil counts may be helpful.
+ Methacholine challenge tests may be useful to distinguish asthma from other diseases causing dyspnea.
Chronic cough – Wake Forest template
**NOTE: Pulmonology E-CONSULT for CHRONIC COUGH is most useful when esophageal reflux and post nasal drip have been assessed (and if present, empirically treated without effect) AND the patient is not on an ACE inhibitor.
** For patients with chronic cough, opioid containing cough syrup(s) are not recommended for prolonged use and may confound appropriate diagnosis.
** Note: ACE levels for presumptive diagnosis/evaluation for Sarcoidosis is not sensitive.
>> Please consider the following:
+ For patients with previous PFTs, include relevant data in the clinical question.
+ For most patients, it is helpful to have some chest imaging (CXR or CT Chest), PFTs (spirometry, lung volumes, DLCO) and CBC with Diff.
+ Including detailed exposure history in the clinical question may aid in diagnosis/management.
+ Chemicals?
+ Indoor pets?
+ Hot tubs?

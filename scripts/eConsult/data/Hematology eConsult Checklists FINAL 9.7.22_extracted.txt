Anemia – Stanford template
To be displayed on a separate screen BEFORE they open the question:
The following situations are generally inappropriate for an anemia eConsult [PLEASE PLACE AN IN-PERSON REFERRAL INSTEAD]:
Presence of uncommon cells on differential or slide review: (e.g. nucleated RBCs, blasts, atypical lymphocytes)
Absolute reticulocyte count < 20K/µL and normal renal function
Severe Hb < 7 g/dL of an acute or unexplained nature should be evaluated in the ER for transfusion.
Unexplained adenopathy or constitutional/B symptoms (e.g. fever, weight loss, or drenching night sweats)
Pancytopenia
Hemolytic anemia
I am requesting an eConsult from Hematology for anemia.  My most current assessment of this problem and management can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
My clinical question is: {SEE CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT BELOW. The more specific you can be, the better response you will get from Hematology. If any of the required information, below, is not provided, there is a high likelihood the consult will have to be declined without this required information.}
CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT:
The following clinical information is required:
+ Previous evaluation and treatment: ***
+ History of gastric bypass: {yes/no}
+ History of infusion/transfusion: {yes/no}
+ Prior EGD/Col: ***
The following studies are required and available in Epic and/or CareEverywhere (n.b. if possible, please convey results in CareEverywhere in your question or note so our specialists don’t have to spend unnecessary time searching for them):
+ CBC with differential
+ Reticulocyte count
+ CMP
+ Ferritin
+ Transferrin saturation
+ Vitamin B12
Clinical Pearls:
I. If the MCV is < 80, please consider the following common scenarios:
A) Iron deficiency anemia – A ferritin < 30 ng/mL is consistent with iron deficiency anemia in the absence of anemia. Take an extensive GI/GU bleeding history.
B) Anemia of chronic inflammation – Generally a ferritin > 100 ng/mL with all other iron indices being low is seen. ESR and CRP may be of value.
C) Copper deficiency – Copper may be low. This is often seen in patients with GI pathology (e.g. gastric bypass, or enteropathies). Excess zinc can also cause copper deficiency.
D) Thalassemia syndromes – If a microcytic anemia is seen with normal iron studies, check a Hb Quant to screen for beta thalassemia. Alpha thalassemia PCR can also be sent. RBC count usually increased despite anemia. Please report the patient’s ethnic background.
II. If the MCV is > 100:
A) Liver disease - Does the patient have known liver disease? Consider getting an abdominal ultrasound and include the spleen.
B) Alcohol – What are the patient’s drinking habits?
C) Medications – Update the medication list to screen for medications associated with macrocytosis.
D) B12 deficiency – Consider sending a methylmalonic acid to more effectively rule out B12 deficiency.
E) Reticulocytosis – Reticulocytes can cause a mild macrocytosis. If bleeding is not evident, please send an LDH, haptoglobin, and DAT. Fractionate the bilirubin if increased.
F) Hypothyroidism – Please send a TSH.
G) MGUS – Send an SPIE and serum free light chains.
H) MDS – Refer to hematology.
III. If the MCV is normocytic, please consider the possibilities above or a mixed microcytic/macrocytic picture.
A) Androgen deficiency – Older men with isolated normocytic anemia and negative workup above
B) Anemia of renal disease – If there is presence of renal dysfunction (GFR < 60), please consider sending an EPO to assess if there is a relative EPO deficiency.

Isolated Erythrocytosis – Stanford template
To be displayed on a separate screen BEFORE they open the question:
The following situations are generally inappropriate for isolated erythrocytosis eConsult [PLEASE PLACE AN IN-PERSON REFERRAL INSTEAD]:
Presence of uncommon cells on differential or slide review: (e.g. nucleated RBCs, blasts, atypical lymphocytes such as smudge cells or hairy cells)
Unexplained adenopathy or constitutional/B symptoms (e.g. fever, weight loss, or drenching night sweats)
Patients with active cardiovascular symptoms chest pain, stroke-like symptoms or vasomotor symptoms (headaches, visual changes, fatigue)
HCT > 60
Low serum EPO
Venous or arterial thrombosis in setting of erythrocytosis
I am requesting an eConsult from Hematology for erythrocytosis.  My most current assessment of this problem and management can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
My clinical question is: {SEE CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT BELOW. The more specific you can be, the better response you will get from Hematology. If any of the required information, below, is not provided, there is a high likelihood the consult will have to be declined.}
CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT:
The following clinical information is required:
+ SpO2 level: ***
+ Updated medications (e.g. testosterone, diuretics), including non-prescription supplements: ***
+ Smoking: ***
+ OSA: ***
The following studies are required and available in Epic and/or Care Everywhere (n.b. if possible, please convey results in Care Everywhere in your question or note so our specialists don’t have to spend unnecessary time searching for them):
+ CBC with differential (on two consecutive checks at least one week apart with adequate hydration)
+ CMP
+ LDH
+ Ferritin
+ Transferrin saturation
+ Serum erythropoietin
+ Urinalysis
CLINICAL PEARLS:
I.  If the EPO level is suppressed or low, please send a JAK2 V617F and refer to hematology.
II. Definition of erythrocytosis/polycythemia is Hb > 16.5 g/dL in men, > 16.0 in women, or HCT > 49 in men, > 48 in women.
III. Please consider that smoking, testosterone, or other anabolic steroids can cause a secondary polycythemia. High altitudes, COPD and sleep apnea (uncommonly) can cause a secondary erythrocytosis. Optional testing includes testosterone and carboxyhemoglobin. Sleep study should be considered in the right clinical context.
IV. Renal cysts, post-renal transplant, congenital heart disease, and renal artery stenosis can cause polycythemia.
V. For patients already being considered for polycythemia or borderline polycythemia, but are iron deficient, do not replete iron without hematology input as this may be a masked polycythemia.
VI. Patients with polycythemia vera may complain of fever, night sweats, weight loss, aquagenic pruritus, erythromelalgia, or early satiety. If early satiety is present, a splenic ultrasound can help build a case for a myeloproliferative neoplasm.

Elevated Ferritin – Stanford template
To be displayed on a separate screen BEFORE they open the question:
The following situations are generally inappropriate for elevated ferritin eConsult [PLEASE PLACE AN IN-PERSON REFERRAL INSTEAD]:
Ferritin > 500
HFE homozygosity
Chronic transfusion history
Known hemoglobinopathy, thalassemia, MDS, or other state of ineffective erythropoiesis or hemolytic anemia
Uncontrolled autoimmune disease or malignancy
I am requesting an eConsult from Hematology for elevated ferritin.  My most current assessment of this problem and management can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
My clinical question is: {SEE CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT BELOW. The more specific you can be, the better response you will get from Hematology. If any of the required information, below, is not provided, there is a high likelihood the consult will have to be declined.}
CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT:
The following clinical information is required:
+ Family history of iron overload: { yes/no}
+ EtOH use: ***
+ Documented exam for hepatosplenomegaly (otherwise an abdominal US should be considered if there is no recent cross-sectional imaging in the past year): ***
The following studies are required and available in Epic and/or Care Everywhere (n.b. if possible, please convey results in Care Everywhere in your question or note so our specialists don’t have to spend unnecessary time searching for them):
+ CBC with differential (on two consecutive checks at least one week apart)
+ CMP
+ Ferritin (fasting and at baseline health)
+ Transferrin saturation (fasting and at baseline health)
+ ESR
+ CRP
+ HFE mutation screening
+ Comprehensive hepatitis panel (SHC lab code LABVP5)
CLINICAL PEARLS:
I.  MRI T2* can help quantify whether or not the serum ferritin is associated with end-organ iron overload. This should be done if the ferritin > 1000 before referring to hematology. Hematology typically will only do phlebotomy if there is evidence of clinically significant iron overload, or if the patient has a true diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis.
II. In general, the liver usually is the organ that incurs iron deposition first. Please be mindful of LFT abnormalities and other downstream end-organ complications such as arrhythmias, arthropathy, or endocrinopathies (T2DM, skin hyperpigmentation, impotence) that may make a hereditary hemochromatosis likely.
III. In general, females may present later with iron overload due to menstrual bleeding. HFE is a very common gene mutation with up to 5-10% of Caucasian patients as a carrier. The vast majority of heterozygous HFE carriers will not need hematology care even for mildly elevated iron parameters. The overall clinical penetrance of hereditary hemochromatosis, even if inherited as homozygous, is low.
IV. Assuming TSAT was done while fasting, a TSAT > 45% could support an iron-avid state.
VI. If there is concern for a hemolytic anemia due to concomitant anemia or bilirubinemia, please send an LDH and haptoglobin. Ineffective erythropoietic states can lead to secondary iron overload.
VII. Some cases of a moderately elevated ferritin are secondary to fatty liver or other known hepatic pathology.
IV. The ferritin level is nonspecific as an acute phase reactant and if not reflecting overall iron body stores, further workup by primary care should attempt to identify an alternative reactive etiology (autoimmune, infectious, inflammatory, malignancy, etc.).

Isolated Leukocytosis – Stanford template
To be displayed on a separate screen BEFORE they open the question:
The following situations are generally inappropriate for isolated leukocytosis eConsult [PLEASE PLACE AN IN-PERSON REFERRAL INSTEAD]:
Presence of uncommon cells on differential or slide review: (e.g. nucleated RBCs, blasts, atypical lymphocytes such as smudge cells or hairy cells)
Unexplained adenopathy or constitutional/B symptoms (e.g. fever, weight loss, or drenching night sweats)
Accompanying cytopenias
Prior chemotherapy or hematologic malignancy
Post-transplant
History of recurrent infections since childhood
Basophilia, Absolute monocytosis (> 1000)
I am requesting an eConsult from Hematology for leukocytosis.  My most current assessment of this problem and management can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
My clinical question is: {SEE CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT BELOW. The more specific you can be, the better response you will get from Hematology. If any of the required information, below, is not provided, there is a high likelihood the consult will have to be declined.}
CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT:
The following clinical information is required:
+ Documented exam for hepatosplenomegaly (otherwise an abdominal US should be considered if there is no recent cross-sectional imaging in the past year): ***
+ Updated medications (e.g. steroids, lithium), including non-prescription supplements: ***
+ Last weight/BMI: ***
+ Smoking: ***
+ Prior splenectomy: {yes/no}
The following studies are required and available in Epic and/or Care Everywhere (n.b. if possible, please convey results in Care Everywhere in your question or note so our specialists don’t have to spend unnecessary time searching for them):
+ CBC with differential (on two consecutive checks at least one week apart)
+ CMP
+ LDH
+ ESR
+ CRP
CLINICAL PEARLS:
I.  If there is mainly a neutrophilia, that this is encountered often with a reactive process: acute or chronic infection, steroids, splenectomy, smoking. As a diagnosis of exclusion, we sometimes see a mild neutrophilic leukocytosis in patients with obesity.
II. If there is a predominant lymphocytosis that remains persistent, then sending a peripheral flow cytometry to look for a monoclonal lymphocytosis is appropriate.
III.  For complexity, we often evaluate hypereosinophilia (AEC > 1500) consults in clinic, but that can be seen in patients with asthma and drug reactions. Please screen for Strongyloides Ab.
IV. If diarrhea is present, consider C. Diff testing if recently hospitalized.
V. Please consider the possibility of asplenia in a patient with multiple cytoses, but if spleen is intact or enlarged, then testing for myeloproliferative disorders is more appropriate. This may include BCR/ABL screening.

ANC < 1000 on two consecutive checks or an ANC < 500 once
Recurrent infections or oral ulcers
Unexplained adenopathy or constitutional/B symptoms (e.g. fever, weight loss, or drenching night sweats)
Pancytopenia
Malignancy
Post-transplant
I am requesting an eConsult from Hematology for leukopenia.  My most current assessment of this problem and management can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
My clinical question is: {SEE CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT BELOW. The more specific you can be, the better response you will get from Hematology. If any of the required information, below, is not provided, there is a high likelihood the consult will have to be declined.}
CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT:
The following clinical information is required:
+ Patient nationality: ***
+ EtOH use: ***
+ Spleen and lymph node exam: ***
+ Updated medications, including non-prescription supplements: ***
+ Ultrasound spleen if no other cross-sectional imaging during documented leukopenia: ***
The following studies are required and available in Epic and/or Care Everywhere (n.b. if possible, please convey results in Care Everywhere in your question or note so our specialists don’t have to spend unnecessary time searching for them):
+ CMP
+ LDH
+ Vitamin B12
+ HIV
+ Hepatitis C antibody
CLINICAL PEARLS:
I. A note about constitutional neutropenia (WBC > 2.5 K/mcL): Many individuals maintain consistently low WBC counts without evidence of increased susceptibility to infection or any other adverse effects. Please consider this diagnosis prior to consulting Hematology.
II. Please screen for copper deficiency especially if there is a history of bariatric surgery or malabsorption
III. Please send an ANA and rheumatoid factor if there is concern for autoimmune disease.
IV. For most asymptomatic neutropenias in which the ANC > 1000 and there has been demonstrated stability over years, the patient can be monitored annually on CBC with differential without hematology referral.
V. If the patient has a lymphopenia with an ALC between 500 and 1000, a quantitative immunoglobulin panel should be sent. We generally do not intervene for patients with asymptomatic lymphocytopenia without an associated illness.

MGUS – Stanford template
To be displayed on a separate screen BEFORE they open the question:
The following situations are generally inappropriate for MGUS/paraproteinemia eConsult [PLEASE PLACE AN IN-PERSON REFERRAL INSTEAD]:
Unexplained anemia, cardiomyopathy, bone pain/fractures, hepatosplenomegaly, hypercalcemia, lytic lesions, macroglossia, nephrotic syndrome/proteinuria, renal insufficiency, neuropathy, purpura, B symptoms.
M-protein > 1.5 g/dL
Isolated FLC ratio > 8
IgA MGUS
I am requesting an eConsult from Hematology for MGUS/paraproteinemia.  My most current assessment of this problem and management can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
My clinical question is: {SEE CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT BELOW. The more specific you can be, the better response you will get from Hematology. If any of the required information, below, is not provided, there is a high likelihood the consult will have to be declined.}
CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT:
The following clinical information is required:
+ Documentation of a complete ROS and Physical Examination (see criteria inappropriate for e-consult): ***
The following studies are required and available in Epic and/or CareEverywhere (n.b. if possible, please convey results in CareEverywhere in your question or note so our specialists don’t have to spend unnecessary time searching for them):
+ CBC with diff
+ CMP
+ SPIE
+ Serum free light chain ratio
+ UPEP (if SPIE or FLC ratio is abnormal)
+ Quantitative Immunoglobulins (if SPIE or FLC ratio is abnormal)
+ Random urine protein-creatinine ratio and microalbumin-creatinine ratio (if UPEP ordered)
CLINICAL PEARLS:
I. The sensitivity of screening for paraproteinemia is up to 98% combining the serum protein electrophoresis, serum protein immunofixation, and serum free light chain assay.
II. Classical “CRAB criteria” are hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, or bone lesions.
III. If M-spike < 1.5 g/dL, IgG subtype, K/L ratio is normal, then they meet criteria for low-risk MGUS. Repeat labs in 6 months and if stable, then annual labwork for paraproteinemia is recommended for patients. Laboratory surveillance can be discontinued for patients with a life expectancy of <5 years and among those >80 years old. The risk of progression for MGUS is usually at most 1% per year to a symptomatic plasma cell proliferative disorder or lymphoproliferative disorder.

Thrombocytosis – Stanford template
To be displayed on a separate screen BEFORE they open the question:
The following situations are generally inappropriate for thrombocytosis eConsult [PLEASE PLACE AN IN-PERSON REFERRAL INSTEAD]:
Presence of uncommon cells on differential or slide review: (e.g. nucleated RBCs, blasts, atypical lymphocytes such as smudge cells or hairy cells)
Unexplained adenopathy or constitutional/B symptoms (e.g. fever, weight loss, or drenching night sweats)
Patients with active cardiovascular symptoms chest pain, stroke-like symptoms or vasomotor symptoms (headaches, visual changes, fatigue)
Venous or arterial thrombosis in setting of thrombocytosis
Platelet count > 1.0 million.
I am requesting an eConsult from Hematology for thrombocytosis.  My most current assessment of this problem and management can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
My clinical question is: {SEE CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT BELOW. The more specific you can be, the better response you will get from Hematology. If any of the required information, below, is not provided, there is a high likelihood the consult will have to be declined.}
CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT:
The following clinical information is required:
+ Documented exam for hepatosplenomegaly (Otherwise an abdominal US should be considered if there is no recent cross-sectional imaging in the past year): ***
+ Recent surgery or medical illness: ***
The following studies are required and available in Epic and/or CareEverywhere (n.b. if possible, please convey results in CareEverywhere in your question or note so our specialists don’t have to spend unnecessary time searching for them):
+ CBC with diff (on two consecutive checks at least one week apart)
+ CMP
+ Ferritin
+ Transferrin saturation
+ ESR
+ CRP
CLINICAL PEARLS:
I.  Patients with a suspected reactive thrombocytosis are not thought to be at greater risk for thrombosis due to the platelet count itself.
II. Patients with extreme thrombocytosis, platelet count > 1.0 million (more often 1.5 million) can present with paradoxical bleeding from acquired von Willebrand disease.
III. Patients with essential thrombocytosis may complain of fever, night sweats, weight loss, aquagenic pruritus, erythromelalgia, or early satiety. If early satiety is present, a splenic ultrasound can help build a case for a myeloproliferative neoplasm.
IV. Asplenic state can lead to chronic thrombocytosis.
V. The majority of thrombocytoses are reactive and efforts should be made to evaluate for inflammatory conditions (rheumatologic, infectious, malignancy) or to associate with recent hospitalizations/surgeries.
VI. Iron deficiency is a common cause of reactive thrombocytosis.
VII. If workup is negative, we may consider searching for an essential thrombocytosis by sending off mutations associated with MPN including JAK2 V617F, CALR, and MPL.

I am requesting an eConsult from Hematology for VTE/Thrombophilia.  My most current assessment of this problem and management can be found in the note dated {Today/***}.
My clinical question is: {SEE CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT BELOW. The more specific you can be, the better response you will get from Hematology. If any of the required information, below, is not provided, there is a high likelihood the consult will have to be declined.}
CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT:
The following clinical information is required:
+ Risk factors for VTE present (make sure to document all: family history, weight, prior VTE, lower extremity exam, updated medication list, age-appropriate cancer screening): ***
+ Imaging or radiology report of VTE: ***
The following studies are required and available in Epic and/or Care Everywhere (n.b. if possible, please convey results in Care Everywhere in your question or note so our specialists don’t have to spend unnecessary time searching for them):
+ CBC with diff (on two consecutive checks at least one week apart)
+ CMP
+ Ferritin
CLINICAL PEARLS:
I. Therapy guideline:  https://depts.washington.edu/anticoag/home/
- Superficial thrombophlebitis – prophylactic dose for 6 weeks if high-risk
- Line-associated DVT – 3 months or until line out, whichever longer
- Distal DVT – 3 months (unless anticoagulation-averse, asymptomatic, low-risk, then serial US)
- Proximal DVT – 3-6 months at the minimum
II. In most circumstances, we do not perform thrombophilia screening or specific management for patients > 45 years old.
III. Avoid testing antithrombin, protein C, protein S during acute thrombosis or active anticoagulation.
IV. Uncommon causes of hypercoagulability (especially if presenting with splanchnic vein thrombosis or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis) include JAK2 mutation and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.
V. Consider screening for proteinuria for nephrotic syndrome.
VI. Consider testing for antiphospholipid syndrome.
VIII. We generally recommend that incidental PE or subsegmental PE be treated as a standard PE.
IX. For provoked VTE due to a surgical risk factor, we recommend finite anticoagulation due to low risk of recurrence.
X. Unprovoked VTE are generally treated indefinitely assuming the bleeding risk is low although should be discussed with hematology further.
XI. The superficial femoral vein is a deep vein!

General Guidelines for Code Repo:
* Avoid any large data files, so the repo stays lightweight for new devs to quickly download/clone.
* For one-off or very project specific files and scripts, basically do whatever you want in the workspace areas under the /scripts directory (but again, avoid big data files).
* Try to promote reusable components to the medinfo core application modules.

Review the Wiki for Starter Notes on using some of the common data sources and codebase as well as general lab/group infrastructure.

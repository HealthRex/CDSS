Potential Primary Causes
- Cardiac: Any structural abnormalities (atrial dilation, valvular disease, infiltrative, ischemia, etc.)
- Pulmonary: Any abnormalities, including PE, COPD
- Ingestions (stimulants, albuterol)
- Rheumatic disease valvular
- Atherosclerotic: MI, CAD
- Thyroid, hyper
- EtOH, Endocarditis
- Sick Sinus



# New Afib Workup
- EKG+Telemetry
- Troponins
- TSH, FT4
- EtOH, UTox
- CXR
- TTEcho
- Ziopatch monitor and Cardiology follow-up appointment on discharge for extended monitoring of episode frequency to plan further cardioversion plans



# Ventricular Rate Control 
(AFFIRM: Rate control as effective as rhythm control for CV risk management, though less exercise tolerance)   
(RACE II: Lenient rate control (HR&lt;110) as effective as strict (HR&lt;80))

Agent Selection 
(Avoid mixing AV nodal blocking classes due to risk of complete block, but can add digoxin as a secondary agent if poor control with primary agent)
- Diltiazem (Avoid in heart failure)
- Beta-blocker (Avoid in reactive airway disease, favor in hyper-thyroid)
- Digoxin (Not for acute control, 2 hour onset.  Favor in heart failure)
- None of the above if WPW / accessory pathway (consider cardioversion, ablation, or anti-arrhythmic instead)

Afib+RVR Acute Rate Control (beware hypotension and address primary causes)
- Diltiazem 0.25mg/kg (15mg) IV x1 then maintain 5-15mg/hr drip
- Metoprolol 2.5-5mg IV up to x3 then PO maintenance
- Esmolol 0.5mg/kg (30mg) IV x1 then 5-15mg/min
- Keep NPO for option of TEEcho + DCCardioversion

Afib Maintenance Rate Control
- Diltiazem 30-90mg PO qid while titrating dose, then transition to SA daily formulation (max 360mg/day)
- Metoprolol 25-100mg PO bid (start q6h while titrating dose)
- Digoxin 0.25mg PO q2h up to 1.5mg then 0.125-0.375mg PO daily
(Check steady-state trough levels within a week, not targeting therapeutic so much as avoiding toxic levels)
  
# Thromboembolism Risk Management
CHADS2 = *** (Annual stroke risk 2-8.5+%) (~60% RRReduction with anticoagulation)
(http://www.mdcalc.com/chads2-score-for-atrial-fibrillation-stroke-risk/)
CHADS2 = 1
- ASA 75-325mg PO daily
CHADS2 > 1 
- Warfarin per pharmacy protocol, goal INR 2-3.  Anti-coagulation clinic follow-up
(Heparin / enoxaparin bridge not strictly necessary (including 1 week breaks for surgeries), unless high risk)
(If non-valvular Afib, adequate renal function, acceptable cost and bleeding risk, consider rivaroxaban or dabigatran)



# AFib+RVR, Unstable (hypotensive, MI, angina, acute heart failure)
- Proceed immediately to (DC) Cardioversion...

# Rhythm Control / Cardioversion
- TEEcho to exclude LAA thombus and embolus risk first, 
(Unless confirmed arrhythmia &lt;48 hours or already anti-coagulated >3 weeks)
(if LAA thrombus identified, high risk for thromboembolism, cardioversion should be deferred unless urgent/unstable)

- Anti-coagulation prior and subsequent to cardioversion
(Stroke / embolism risk 1-7% if not anti-coagulated, equivalent between DC and pharmacologic cardioversion.  1 month anticoagulation or TEEcho guided therpay reduces risk &lt;1%)
(Even if convert to sinus rhythm, "stunned" myocardium still prone to thrombus and embolism especially in first 10 days, warranting ongoing anticoagulation)
(No clear end point for anticoagulation, due to potential recurrence and ongoing thromboembolism risk)
- If Afib>48hrs, warfarin x3 weeks before then 4 weeks after cardioversion
- If Afib>48hrs + negative TEEcho, heparin/warfarin for 5 days before then 4 weeks after
- If Afib&lt;48hrs, start heparin/enoxaparin and proceed to cardiovert
- If emergent cardioversion, heparin drip immediately then warfarin 4 weeks after

- DC Cardioversion (100-200J biphasic) under sedation with anesthesia and NPO
(>80% successful conversion, but ~50% annual relapse, consider suppressing with anti-arrhythmics after 2nd cardioversion)

- Pharmacologic Cardioversion (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) 
(Most effective within 7 days of onset.  Equivalent stroke risk between DC and pharmacologic cardioversion.)
- Amiodarone 
1.2-1.8g/day until 10g total
(e.g. 150mg IV bolus, then 1mg/min x6 hrs, then 0.5mg/min for 18 hours, overlap PO with drip due to > 1 week for PO onset, 400mg PO bid x1 week), then 200-400mg PO daily 
  or
800mg / day x1 week, then 600mg / day x1 week, then 400mg / day x 4-6 weeks, then 200mg / day 
- Monitor TFTs, LFTs, K, Mg (q3-6months) and one baseline PFT + annual CXRs while on prolonged amiodarone

- Cardiology EP Consultation for other regimens, ablation, pacer strategies, etc.

Elevated INR is actually misleading, patient missing both pro- and anti-coagulant factors, and should receive VTE prophylaxis (heparin) if Plt>50
 - For purposes of procedure (i.e., paracentesis), can administer FFP, platelets, cryoprecipitate respectively (goal INR&lt;2, Plt>50, fibrinogen>100), but no data to support.  Can't really avoid bleed risks (though minimal for paracentesis anyway).

# Diagnostics
- CBC, BMP+Phos
- UA, Beta-hydroxybutyrate (assess for presence of ketones)
- Serum Osmolality
- ABG/VBG to assess severity of acidemia
# Trigger Assessment
- CXR, UA, Blood Cultures for infection
- Troponin, EKG for ischemia
- Lipase for pancreatitis

# Initial Treatment
- Insulin (regular) 0.1u/kg (~10 units) IV x1
- Insulin drip, DKA protocol (requires NPO)
- Isotonic (NS,LR) bolus 1L / hr until euvolemic (expect extensive volume depletion, could require 5L+)
- Foley catheter for high urine output monitoring
- Consider arterial/central line for repeated labs
- Treat any underling causes

# Treatment Maintenance
- Glucose: q1h to titrate insulin
- Lab monitoring: q2-4h BMP+Phosphorus+pH (ABG/VBG) 

- Continue Insulin drip, DKA protocol
- If pH&lt;6.9, consider D5W + 100mEq NaHCO3 IVF for few hours
- Maintenance fluids 1/2NS ~200mL/hr
  - Change to D5 1/2NS when glucose &lt;250
  - Change to D5 1/2NS + 20-40mEq KCl when demonstrated urine output and K &lt;5.5
     - If K&lt;3.5, aggressively replete and hold insulin for couple hours until K>4
  - Replete phosphorus with KPhos 20-40mmol if Phos severely low &lt;1 (less evidence)
  
- Goal to normalize anion gap (eliminate beta-hydroxy butyrate / ketones) due to insulin deficiency (glucose and potassium repletion expected)

# Resolution / Transition
When normalize anion gap and low stable insulin requirement for 4 hours
- Calculate/extrapolate 24hr insulin requirement (example below)
- Start long acting insulin (NPH) then stop drip 2-3 hours AFTER to bridge effect
- Stop fluids and start carb-controlled diet

Sample Calculation:  Coming Off Insulin drip, Starting Diet
- Stable ~2 units / hr while NPO on drip
- 24hr need estimate 2x24 = 48 units
- 75% reduced need as "less stressed" = 75%x48 = 36 units
Orders:
- Insulin NPH 9 units SubQ bid (18 units split in two)
- Insulin Aspart 6 units SubQ qac (matching prandial doses once start eating meals / bolus feeds)
- Insulin Aspart Sliding Scale

Example Algorithm from Up-to-Date


# Mild DKA / Non-Drip / Non-ICU Management (monitored floors may allow insulin drip)
- Can try rapid acting Insulin lispro or aspart SubQ ~0.1u/kg/hr (~10u/hr) until glucose&lt;250 then 0.05 (~5u/hr) until ketoacidosis resolved

- Consider colectomy in severely ill (monitor lab trends, intervene before bad peri-operative mortality once WBC>50K, lactate>5)

- 1st Recurrence: Same regimen for first recurrence of same severity
- Further Recurrences: Vancomycin taper 125mg PO qid x2 weeks, then bid x1 week, then daily x1 week, then qod x2-8 weeks

Typical Acute Leukemia Timeline
= Admit =
â—¾Order diagnostic labs
â—¾Consent for blood transfusions
â—¾Get PICC line
â—¾Pre-chemo TTEcho
â—¾Fellow does BM biopsy for diagnostics
â—¾If clotting evidence or otherwise concern for APLeukemia, fellow will empirically start ATRA (tretinoin)

= Day 1-7 =
â—¾Induction chemotherapy (variable depending on regimen chosen)
â—¾Monitor Tumor Lysis labs (K, Cr, Ca, Phos, LDH, Uric Acid)  
Mostly just keep hydrated to flush these out, and standing allopurinol 300mg PO bid while at active risk.  Only other meaningful intervention is rasburicase if uric acid >10, but requires a call to fellow.  Only relevant if very high WBC and early during induction chemotherapy.
â—¾Monitor DIC screen first several days, though mostly only looking at fibrinogen for cryoprecipitate repletion

= Day 7-21 =
â—¾Most severe period of pancytopenia
â—¾Daily CBC to monitor for blood and platelet transfusion
â—¾Neutropenic fever almost inevitably develops, grapple with this daily, as it represents the major threat to your patients' survival

= Day 14 =
Depending on treatment protocol, fellow will often do a repeat bone marrow biopsy.  Purpose is to verify an empty "hypocellular" marrow, to verify the chemo was effective at suppressing the leukemia

= Day 21-28 =
â—¾Usually expect to see recovery of normal bone marrow (e.g., ANC>500 and Plt>100k) with reduced transfusion requirements
â—¾Once not neutropenic, can start peeling off all antibiotics
â—¾May recheck bone marrow biopsy (or defer to clinic follow-up) after count recovery: If no leukemia present (&lt;5% blasts) = disease remission.  If leukemia still present = refractory disease, warranting re-induction with different chemo regimen
â—¾Arrange outpatient follow-up either with patient's local hematologist or with admitting attending from Hematology service
â—¾Make sure expensive discharge meds are approved well in advance (e.g., voriconazole, ATRA, Neupogen).  Work with the Case Manager early to ensure these are in order early.  The Case Manager matters more for approving discharge than the attending does.

Transfusions
 - Keep patients Type & Screened every 3 days (can order standing this way) so will always be ready.
 - In general
   Transfuse 2 units PRBC if Hgb&lt;7
   Transfuse 1 unit Platelets if Plt&lt;10
   Transfuse 1 unit (10 pooled) Cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen&lt;100</textarea><br>

- Blood Cultures + CSF Studies
- CT Head NOT necessary in most cases (unless focal neuro sx, altered mentation, known CNS lesions, seizures, immunocompromised)
  (If need CT, blood cultures, then antibiotics before CT Head to avoid potentially lethal average delay of 2 hours)

Lumbar Puncture / CSF Analysis
  - Opening Pressure (&lt;20-25cm can consider normal)
  - Cell Counts: WBC
    (if excess RBC, check peripheral RBC/WBC ratio or default 1000:1 to 500:1 ratio)
  - Glucose (normal 2/3 of serum)
  - Protein (normal &lt;38)
  - Lactate>4 more suggestive of bacterial
  - Gram Stain + Culture
  - Additional Studies depending on context: 
    HSV PCR, Entero / other viral PCR, fungal Cx, AFB Smear + Cx, TB PCR, Crypto Ag

Empiric Treatment
- Vancomycin 20mg/kg load x1, then 15mg/kg IV q12hr, goal trough 15-20
- Ceftriaxone 2g IV q12h

Optional Treatments
- Ampicillin 2g IV q4h if young child, old (>50), immunocompromised (Listeria coverage)
- Cefepime 2g IV q8h if surgical exposure (Pseudomonas coverage)
- Acyclovir 10mg/kg IV q8h if altered mental status, focal neurologic Sx (suspect HSV encephalitis)

- Cardiology Consult / Interventional Assessment

- ASA 81mg PO daily (initial 162-324mg = 2-4x 81mg chewable tablets)
(Consider higher dose >30 days if get BMStent, >3 months if get DEStent, otherwise CURE trial suggests 81mg should be adequate, while higher doses just increase bleeding)
- Clopidogrel 75mg PO daily (initial load 300mg if no cath, 600mg if cath planned) 
(Hold 5 days if surgery / CABG planned, suggested by diabetes, cardiogenic shock or VA patient since likely multi-vessel disease that will need surgery, probably should ask Cards fellow or attending first)
(Continue >30 days if get BMStent, >1 year if DEStent or only planning medical management)
- Atorvastatin 80mg PO daily, check lipid panel 
(Start high-dose statin prior to discharge regardless as per MIRACL and PROV-IT)

- Consider Beta-blocker: Metoprolol 12.5mg PO bid (titrate to goal HR&lt;70) 
(Hold if SBP&lt;90 / cardiogenic shock) 
(Beware may actually worsen near-term mortality from shock, especially if use IV.  Start prior to discharge)
- NTG + morphine PRN chest pain or NTG drip if ongoing chest pain 
(Hold if hypotensive / cardiogenic shock / inferior MI / sildenafil within past 24 hours)

- Anti-coagulation (Heparin drip per ACS protocol)
(Enoxaparin if planning medical management only (no cath), slightly superior as per ESSENCE, more appropriate if Low Risk TIMI &lt;=2, but ask Interventional first as they usually prefer reversible and monitorable heparin)
(Continue until catheterization or at least 48hrs if only medical management)

(High Risk TIMI >=3) (Favor GP IIb/IIIa and early angiography)
- Consider GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (e.g., eptifibatide) if ongoing chest pain, elevated troponin on presentation, heart failure, diabetes or otherwise planning early angiography (within 24-48hrs), but only helps if actually getting catheterization and per ACUITY and EARLY, same effect if wait until just prior to PCI, so usually defer to interventional cardiology
(Continue until catheterization, then 6-12 hours)

Prior to Discharge (core measures)
- Assess LV Function (i.e., TTEcho)
- ACE-I / ARB if EF&lt;40% (though GISSI-3 indicates can help regardless of EF)

? Indication to Tap
Any new pleural effusion large enough to tap (e.g., >1cm on lateral decubitus X-ray)
Unless simply CHF / volume overload with bilateral effusions, afebrile and effusion resolves within 3 days

? Transudate vs. Exudate
Lightâ€™s criteria (Exudate if any ONE criteria satisfied)
- Pleural LDH > 2/3 upper limit of normal serum LDH (340 at Stanford)
- Pleural / Serum LDH > 0.6
- Pleural / Serum Total Protein > 0.5

Transudate DDx
CHF (90%), cirrhosis (hepatic hydrothorax), pulmonary embolism, nephrotic syndrome, peritoneal dialysis, myxedema, constrictive pericarditis, SVC syndrome.

Exudate DDx
Infection, cancer, connective tissue disease, pancreatitis, uremia, chylothorax, drug reaction, post-MI/CABG, esophageal rupture.

? Diagnostic Labs / Exudative Fluid Analysis
(See Specimen Testing, Pleural Fluid Order Set)
- LDH, Protein + Serum LDH, Protein to assess Light's criteria (transudate / exudate)
- Cell Count, pH, glucose to suggest certain infectious / inflammatory sources
- Cultures (optional Gram stain, anaerobic, AFB, Fungal depending on suspicion)
- Cytology (Malignancy?)
- Adenosine Deaminase (TB effusion?)
- Amylase (Pancreatitis, esophageal rupture, adenocarcinoma)

- Cell Count with differential:
  PMNs > 50%: Parapneumonic, PE, pancreatitis.
  Lymphs >50%: Cancer, TB, fungus or post-surgery 
  Eos >10%: PTX, hemothorax, drug reaction, asbestos, parasite infection, Churg-Strauss
- Culture: Yield is increased if fluid sent in blood culture bottles. Send for fungus and mycobacteria if pleural lymphs > 50 % or clinical picture is suspicious. Yield in Tb is &lt;50%.
- Glucose: Level &lt;60 mg/dL is seen in complicated parapneumonic effusion, malignancy, hemothorax, Tb, RA, SLE, Churg-Strauss, parasite infection.
- Cytology: A case series of 971 lung cancer patients reported 7% prevalence of pleural effusion on chest xray and 40% of these pleural effusions had positive cytology. If cytology is negative and cancer is suspected, pleural biopsy should be performed.
- Adenosine Deaminase(ADA) for Tb: At least 50% of tuberculous pleural effusions do not involve other organs and are therefore difficult to diagnose. ADA levels >40-60 U/L in the setting of a lymphocytic effusion are specific for Tb.
- Amylase: Elevated in patients with pancreatitis, esophageal rupture, and malignancies.

15% of exudative effusions have no determined cause. For both transudative and exudative effusions without a cause, pulmonary embolism should be considered. Further evaluation by pleural biopsy via thoracoscopy or open biopsy is indicated for undiagnosed, unresolved exudative effusion.  Therapeutic drainage and assessment for reaccumulation is also informative.

POISE trial and meta-analysis indicate reduced MI rate, but actually increased mortality related to hypotension and stroke.  If going to start, better to initiate days-weeks in advance to ensure tolerance rather than just hours pre-operatively.  More appropriate if already have baseline indication: Angina, MI, CHF

+ Stress testing should only be considered if it would actually change management.  
CARP trial and DECREASE-V Pilot Study found no improvement in outcomes with pre-operative revascularization compared to medical therapy if no inherent indication for CAD revascularization.
If positive stress test findings actually did warrant PCI+BMStent based on inherent CAD criteria (high risk lesions, poorly controlled angina), would delay surgery at least 7 days post angioplasty or 30 days for BMStent + clopidogrel.  If such delay would not be acceptable, stress testing or revascularization consideration would not be useful.

- No oral diabetes medications.  Cut long-acting insulin dose in half for surgery / NPO
- Start statins if not already on for major vascular surgery
- Hold ACE-I if large fluid shifts or bleeding expected

+ Peri-Operative Anticoagulation and Meds
- ASA stopped 7 days prior if surgeon requests and is medically reasonable
- Clopidogrel stopped 5 days prior. Delay surgery if recent stent requires uninterrupted clopidogrel.
- Bridging anticoagulation: Should be done in high risk Afib (high CHADS score or previous cardioembolic event), any mechanical mitral or tricuspid valve, and mechanical aortic valves when the patient has at least one risk factor for thrombosis (Afib, reduced LV function, hypercoagulable state etc). If AVR and no risk factors, then ok to not bridge given low daily risk of thrombosis (4% per year).
- Warfarin: Stop 5 days prior for normal INR at time of surgery. Bridge with lovenox/UFH starting 2 days after stopping warfarin. Stop lovenox 24 hours prior to surgery and stop UFH 4-5 hours prior to surgery.
- Dabigatran: Stop 1-2 days prior to surgery</textarea><br>

+ Venous Stasis: Immobilization, stroke, paresis, paralysis, chronic heart disease
+ Endothelial Injury: Surgery / central venous instrumentation (within 3 months) 

== Diagnostic Approach ==
- Well's Score - 
(Risk Stratification)
http://www.mdcalc.com/wells-criteria-for-dvt/
http://www.mdcalc.com/wells-criteria-for-pulmonary-embolism-pe/
- PERC Score - 
(If low Well's risk, PERC score rules out PE without further testing.  Lack of tachycardia and hypoxia in general suggests low-value in trying to diagnose subsegmental PE)
http://www.mdcalc.com/perc-rule-for-pulmonary-embolism/
- D-Dimer - 
(If not high-risk, - D-Dimer can rule out VTE with high NPValue, but often non-specifically +)

Confirmatory Testing 
(If high risk or D-Dimer non-negative (>age x10), need confirmatory testing)
- Extremity DVT US -
(If positive, stop testing as same treatment as PE.  If negative, but high suspicion, repeat US in 1 week.  If negative but still concern for PE, still need PE confirmatory study)
- CT Angiogram PE Protocol -
(Needs 20g or larger IV access in antecubital or more proximal site, and beware contrast-induced nephropathy.  Local radiology will accept IJ central line, but not EJ due to risk of blowout.) 
- V/Q Scan -
(Nuclear scan not as reliable, especially if baseline abnormal CXR findings, and only available on weekdays.  Benefit is no nephrotoxic contrast)

? Massive PE  = Hemodynamic Instability (SBP&lt;90) -> Consider Thromobolysis vs. Embolectomy and support with IVF + vasopressors
? Respiratory Stability, O2 Desaturation -> Consider Intubation
- Check Troponin, BNP, EKG for S1Q3T3 as prognostic indicators (R heart strain)
(Abnormalities may indicate TTEcho to evaluate R heart strain (McConnell's sign), though debatable whether this will change management (usually wish to avoid risks of thrombolysis))

- Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) -
Per "Outpatient versus inpatient treatment for patients with acute pulmonary embolism: an international, open-label, randomised, non-inferiority trial," Lancet. 2011;378(9785):41, PMID: 21703676, patients PESI class I or II do just as well with outpatient as inpatient treatment
http://www.mdcalc.com/pulmonary-embolism-severity-index-pesi/
- ED to CDU observation admission protocol

== Treatment / Anticoagulation ==
- Warfarin start 5-10mg/day and titrate as per pharmacy protocol 
  - Anti-coagulation clinic or PCP referral follow-up to maintain therapeutic INR 2-3
  >3 months for provoked DVT (assuming provoking factor e.g., surgery/trauma relieved)
  >3-6 months for idiopathic DVT (post-treatment D-Dimer can guide clot vs. bleed risk)
  Indefinitely if persistent risk factor (e.g., malignancy) or recurrent episode

- Enoxaparin 1mg/kg SubQ q12h or 1.5mg/kg SubQ daily bridge 
  At least 5 days and until therapeutic INR 2-3 for 24 hours 
  (Not approved if on dialysis, use UFHeparin.)
  (Dosing adjustment if renal impairment or obesity.  Check anti-Xa levels 4 hours after)
  (If malignancy, favor LMWHeparin indefinitely over warfarin as per CLOT trial)
  - Nursing teaching for patient self-administration

(Rivaroxaban or dabigatran may be appropriate for VTE treatment, but not yet standard of care)
- Rivaroxaban 15mg PO bid x3 weeks then 20mg PO daily as per EINSTEIN-PE (2013)

- Graduated compression stockings to DVT leg to reduce post-thrombotic syndrome

? Indications for IVC Filter placement ?
. Contraindication to or failure of anti-coagulation
. High bleed risk?: Age>65, prior bleeds, thrombocytopenia, anti-platelet therapy, poor anti-coag control, recent surgery, frequent falls, reduced functional capacity, prior stroke, DM, anemia, malignancy, renal failure, liver failure, EtOH abuse.
. IVC Filter only reduces near-term risk of further embolisms, doesn't help clots already in lungs or change mortality (actually increases DVT rate) (PREPIC 1998).
- Consult IR/Vascular for IVC Filter placement

? Upper Extremity DVT ?
(No data on upper extremity DVT, so just treat like lower extremity DVT.  Usually main intervention is remove IV line that instigated it.)

? Thrombophilia Workup ?
. Do not bother if have other obvious risk factor 
  (Recent trauma, surgery, immobillzation, malignancy, lupus, IBD, myeloproliferative disorder, HIT, preeclampsia)
. Do not bother unless suspected family history or recurrent disease.  
. Testing often unreliable in setting of active clot and anticoagulation.  
. Major risk factor for recurrence is the DVT/PE itself, whether it was provoked or not  
. Screening for family members would not likely recommend primary prophylaxis, except to caution women to beware of higher risk oral contraceptives and pregnancy.
. Consider more if family history, weird locations (mesenteric, hepatic, portal, splenic, renal, cerebral veins), baseline prolonged PTT -> antiphospholipid?

Per "Antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (2008)."
"Presence of hereditary thrombophilia has not been used as a major factor to guide duration of anticoagulation for VTE in these guidelines because evidence from prospective studies suggests that these factors are not major determinants of the risk of recurrence."

- Protein C or S deficiency (but also depleted by clot, warfarin)
- Antithrombin deficiency (but also depleted by clot, heparin) 
(If above checked at all, should be checked couple weeks AFTER completion of anticoagulation, though normal levels drawn at initial presentation will essentially exclude these abnormalities)
- Factor V Leiden
- Anti-phospholipid Ab (prolonged PTT, lupus anti-coagulant, anti-cardiolipin, beta-2 glycoprotein I Ab, DRVVT, must be verified twice at 12 week interval)

This was likely due to the blood pressure medication lisinopril. However, you recently also started taking the medication hydrochlorothiazide (a sulfa medication) so it&apos;s possible that you have a sulfa allergy. Do not take lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide.     1) Do not take lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide  2) Continue to take amlodipine (also known as norvasc)  3) See your primary medical doctor (Dr. JJJJ) to discuss alternative medications you can take for your blood pressure.  4) You may have increased risk of pancreatic cancer given your family history of pancreatic cancer. Please see a Stanford gastroenterologist for follow-up (a referral has been placed). You will need either endoscopic  ultrasounds OR MRI imaging done every 6 months for monitoring given your increased risk.     Warning Signs:  Fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, increased lip swelling, any tongue swelling, or any other new or  worsening symptoms. Call your primary care doctor should you develop  these symptoms. If the symptoms are severe, then go to the nearest  emergency room.    You should be contacted for an appointment. If you do not  hear from anyone within the next 3 days, then contact the discharge  coordinator, CCC, at 650-725-6879 to verify your follow-up  appointment.

It occurs when you breathe (aspirate) things into your lungs such as food, vomit or liquid. When these things get into your lungs, swelling (inflammation) can occur. This can make it difficult for you to breath. Aspiration pneumonia is a serious condition and can be life threatening.      CAUSES   Aspiration pneumonia can have many causes. Some of the causes include:  ? Having a brain injury or disease:  l Stroke.  l Seizures.  l Confusion (Dementia).   l ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig&apos;s disease).  l Parkinson&apos;s disease.  ? Other causes of aspiration pneumonia:  l Being under general anesthesia.  l Being in a coma (unconscious). This unconscious state can be caused by drugs, injury or disease. Being in a coma can decrease a person&apos;s gag reflex, which can make it easier for aspiration to occur.   l A narrowing of the esophagus (the tube that carries food to the stomach).  l Having dental problems that make it hard to swallow.  l Drinking too much alcohol. If a person passes out and vomits, vomit can be swallowed into the lungs.  l Taking certain medications. Tranquilizers and sedatives can sometimes decrease your swallowing or gag reflex.     SYMPTOMS   ? Coughing after swallowing food or liquids.   ? Breathing problems. These could include wheezing (a whistling sound) or shortness of breath.   ? Bluish skin. This can be caused by lack of oxygen.   ? Fever.   ? Chest pain.  ? Coughing up food or mucus. The mucus might contain blood, pus or greenish material.  ? Fatigue (being more tired than usual).  ? Sweating more than usual.  ? Bad breath.     DIAGNOSIS   A physical examination and testing will be needed to see if aspiration pneumonia is present. This can include:  ? A review of the above symptoms.  ? Chest X-ray. This gives a picture of the lungs.  ? Listening through a stethoscope. The healthcare provider will listen for:  l Crackling sounds in the lungs.  l Decreased breath sounds.  l A rapid heartbeat.  ? Swallowing study. This test looks at how food is swallowed and whether it goes into your breathing tube (trachea) or food pipe (esophagus).   ? Sputum culture. Sputum (saliva and mucus) is collected from the lungs or bronchi (tubes that carry air to the lungs). It is then tested for bacteria.  ? Computed tomography. This is called a CT scan. It also can show lung damage.   ? Bronchoscopy. This test uses a flexible tube (a bronchoscope) to see inside the lungs.      TREATMENT  Treatment will depend on how severe the aspiration pneumonia is and what led to it.  ? Some people may need to be treated in the hospital. Your breathing will be carefully monitored. Depending on how well you are breathing, you may:  l Be able to breath on your own but need oxygen.  l Need breathing support via a breathing machine. (ventilator).   ? Medication:  l Antibiotics or anti-fungal drugs might be prescribed. The particular medicine will depend on what caused the infection.  l Other drugs may be given to reduce fever and/or pain.  ? Other treatments or corrections may be needed. For example:  l Following a recommended diet. This is especially important if the swallowing study was failed.   l Revising medications.  l Fixing dental problems.  l Correcting breathing obstructions.  l Treating stomach disorders.  l Dealing with alcohol issues.  l Having a feeding tube placed in the stomach.      HOME CARE INSTRUCTIONS   ? Take any medicines that were prescribed. Follow the directions carefully.  ? Check with your caregiver before taking over-the-counter medications.  ? Rest as instructed by your caregiver.  ? Keep all follow-up appointments with your healthcare provider. This is important so the caregiver can make sure the pneumonia is gone.     SEEK MEDICAL CARE IF:  Any of these symptoms return:  ? Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.  ? Wheezing.  ? Fever of more than 100.5 F (38.1 C) or as recommended by your caregiver.  ? Chest pain.     MAKE SURE YOU:   ? Understand these instructions.   ? Will watch your condition.  ? Will get help right away if you are not doing well or get worse.     Document Released: 10/15/2010  Document Re-Released: 12/06/2010  ExitCare? Patient Information ?2011 ExitCare, LLC.  Dysphagia (Swallowing Problems)      Swallowing problems occur when solids and liquids seem to stick in your throat on the way down to your stomach, or the food takes longer to get to the stomach. Other symptoms (problems) include regurgitating (burping) up food, noises coming from the throat, chest discomfort with swallowing, and a feeling of fullness in the throat when swallowing. When blockage in the throat is complete it may be associated with drooling.     CAUSES OF DYSPHAGIA (SWALLOWING PROBLEMS)  There are many causes of swallowing difficulties and the following is generalized information regarding a number of reasons for this problem. Problems with swallowing may occur because of problems with the muscles. The food cannot be propelled in the usual manner into the stomach. There may be ulcers, scar tissue or inflammation (soreness) in the esophagus (the food tube from the mouth to the stomach) which blocks food from passing normally into the stomach. Causes of inflammation include acid reflux from the stomach into the esophagus. Inflammation can also be caused by the herpes simplex virus, Candida (yeast), radiation (as with treatment of cancer), or inflammation from medications not taken with adequate fluids to wash them down into the stomach. There may be nerve problems so signals cannot be sent adequately telling the muscles of the esophagus to contract and move the food along. Achalasia is a rare disorder of the esophagus in which muscular contractions of the esophagus are uncoordinated. Globus hystericus is a relatively common problem in young females in which there is a sense of an obstruction or difficulty in swallowing, but in which no abnormalities can be found. This problem usually improves over time with reassurance and testing to rule out other causes.     EVALUATION (DIAGNOSIS) OF SWALLOWING PROBLEMS  A number of tests will help your caregiver know what is the cause of your  swallowing problems. These tests may include a barium swallow in which x-rays are taken while you are drinking a liquid that outlines the lining of the esophagus on x-ray. If the stomach and small bowel are also studied in this manner it is called an upper gastrointestinal exam (UGI). Endoscopy may be done in which your caregiver examines your throat, esophagus, stomach and small bowel with an instrument like a small flexible telescope. Motility studies which measure the effectiveness and coordination of the muscular contractions of the esophagus may also be done.     TREATMENT AND ITS IMPORTANCE  The treatment of swallowing problems are many, varying from medications to surgical treatment. The treatment varies with the type of problem found. Your caregiver will discuss your results and treatment with you. If swallowing problems are severe the long term problems which may occur include: malnutrition, pneumonia (from food going into the breathing tubes called trachea and bronchi), and an increase in tumors (lumps) of the esophagus.     SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION IF:  ? Food or other object becomes lodged in your throat or esophagus and won?t move.     Document Released: 12/15/2001  Document Re-Released: 01/29/2008  ExitCare?

Patient Care Services  300 Pasteur Drive  Stanford, CA 94305      The Patient was given access to the following documents on Jul 3, 2034   CAROTID ENDARTERECTOMY - Discharge Care, English (SaveNote version)                 Patient Care Services  300 Pasteur Drive  Stanford, CA 94305  CAROTID ENDARTERECTOMY  WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW:  A carotid endarterectomy (en-dar-ter-ek-tuh-mee) is surgery to remove plaque (fat) from inside your carotid artery. The carotid artery is a blood vessel found in both sides of your neck. Surgery will clean the carotid artery so blood can flow to your brain better. You will have an  incision on the side of your neck after surgery. The stitches that close the incision are under the skin and will dissolve.        AFTER YOU LEAVE:  Your medicines are:           .   Keep a written list of what medicines you take and when and why you take them. Bring the list of your medicines or the pill bottles when you see your caregivers. Ask your caregiver for information about your medicines. Do not take any medicines, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, herbs, or food supplements without first talking to caregivers. Your caregivers can find out if these medicines interact with other medicines that you are taking.    Always take your medicine as directed by caregivers. Call your caregiver if you think your medicines ar    e not helping or if you feel you are having side effects. Do not quit taking it until you discuss it with your caregiver. If you are taking antibiotics (an-ti-bi-ah-tiks), take them until they are all gone even if you feel better. You should take antibiotics before and after dental work.    If you are taking medicine that makes you drowsy, such as pain medicine, do not drive or use heavy equipment.    Your caregiver may prescribe blood thinners, such as aspirin or other antiplatelet medications, to take after you are discharged from the hospital. This is to replace the blood thinning medicine you may have been receiving in your IV in the hopsital. This medicine helps to stop blood from forming clots.    Blood pressure medicine may be needed to lower your blood pressure after your surgery. You may have to take it for the rest of your life. You will need to ask your primary care physican if you need to continue the blood pressure medication or any other new medications after you leave the hospital.    You should resume taking all of the medications that you were taking at home, prior to coming into the hospital for surgery, unless you are told otherwise by your Vascular Surgeon.   Appointment: You have a follow-up appointment scheduled on           at           with           .   Write down questions you have about having a carotid endarterectomy. This way you&apos;ll remember to ask these questions during your next visit.  You will need to make an appointment to see your primary doctor one week after discharge from the hospital. Your doctor should review with you all of the medications you are taking and decide if any changes need to be made to those medications.  Numbness: It is normal for the area around your incision and the side of your face around your jawline to be numb after surgery. This should go away in less than a year. The earlobe on the same side as surgery may feel numb. This may only last a short time or it may last forever.  Bathing: You may shower 72 hours (3 days) after your surgery. You should not soak in a bathtub, hot tub, or swimming pool until your incision is well healed.  Incision Care: Carefully wash the incision with soap and water and pat dry. You may have steri-strips (thin strips of tape) on your incision. As they start to peel off, let them fall off by themselves. Do not pull them off. Do not use lotions, creams, or powder on the incision.  Dental Prophylaxis: If a man-made (synthetic) patch is used to close your carotid artery during surgery, you will require antibiotics prior to all dental procedures, including teeth cleaning, for the rest of your life. You should not have any dental cleaning or elective dental care for at least 90 days after your surgery. Notify your dentist prior to your dental appointment that you have a patch (of synthetic graft) on your carotid artery. You will also require antibiotics prior to any invasive procedure or surgery in the future. Any health care provider who is involved in your care should be made aware of this recommendation.  BM: It may be hard for you to have a bowel movement (BM) after the  procedure. Don&apos;t try to push the BM out if it&apos;s too hard. Walking is the best way to get your bowels moving. Eat foods high in fiber to make it easier to have a BM. Good examples are high fiber cereals, beans, vegetables, and whole grain breads. Prune juice may help make the BM softer. You will be given a prescription for a stool softener that you should take for a couple of weeks, twice a day unless you have diarrhea. Drinking fluids and keeping yourself well hydrated, increasing your activity level, and eating fruit regularly will also help.  Rest and Activity:  You may feel like resting more after surgery. Slowly start to do more each day. Rest when you feel it is needed.    Walking is the best exercise to start first. Take short walks several times a day, gradually increasing the distance and time that you walk. In the first two weeks after surgery, avoid power walking and physically over-exerting yourself. Ask your doctor when you can resume all of your normal activites.    Talk to your caregiver before you start exercising. Together you can plan the best exercise program for you. It is best to start slowly and do more as you get stronger. Exercising makes the heart stronger, lowers blood pressure, and keeps you healthy. During the first 3 months after surgery, do not bend a lot or play contact sports like football.    Avoid straining or bending over with your head down.    Avoid heavy housework or yard work for 30 days.    Do not lift anything heavier than 5 pounds for 3 weeks.    You may drive in 2 weeks. You need to have full range of motion of your neck so that you can see over each shoulder when you turn your head before you can drive.    You may return to work when your doctor tells you that it is okay.    You may have sex when you feel ready. Remember that this can be strenuous activity. Stop if it causes pain. Talk to your caregiver if you have questions or concerns.  Wellness Hints:    Eat healthy foods from all of the 5 food groups: fruits, vegetables, breads, dairy products, meat and fish. Eating healthy foods may help you feel better and have more energy. It may also help you heal faster.     Your diet will not be restricted after your carotid surgery unless your primary care physician recommends this. Please check with your primary care physician about your diet restrictions.    You may be told to eat foods that are low in fat. It is important to control your cholesterol level and prevent future plaques from forming. Ask for the CareNotes  handout about low fat diets for more information.    You may also be told to limit the amount of salt you eat. This may mean you should not add salt to your food during meals or when you cook. Ask for the CareNotes  handout about low salt diets for more information.    It can take time getting used to a new diet. Special cook books may help the cook in the family find new recipes.  A healthy diet is important for your incision to heal well.  Drink 6 to 8 (8-ounce) glasses of liquid each day. Or, follow your caregiver&apos;s advice if you must limit the amount of liquid you drink. Good liquids to drink are water, juices, and milk. Limit the amount of caffeine you drink, such as coffee, tea, and soda. It is best to drink decaffeinated beverages as the caffeine can dehydrate you.    Stress may slow healing and cause illness later. Since it is hard to avoid stress, learn to control it. Learn new ways to relax (deep breathing, relaxing muscles, meditation, or biofeedback). Talk to your caregiver about things that upset you.    CALL THE VASCULAR SURGERY CLINIC AT (650) 725-5227 IF:  You get a temperature over 101 F (38.3 C) or you have chills.

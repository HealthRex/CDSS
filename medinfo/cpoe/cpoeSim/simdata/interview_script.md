**NOTES from Watching Video** 

- [ ] This is low stakes: writing the code (nothing broke) you can order whatever you want 
- [ ] Oddities names won't always match 
- [ ] Sodium chloride intravenous (not sodium) 
- [ ] This is all basic functionality not what we are testing on 
- [ ] Get you familiar with the case 
- [ ] Look for things out loud 
- [ ] Now the difference is the point of the study the new functionality that doesn't exist in the EHR 
- [ ] Understand basic structure but this kind of functionality 
- [ ] You can completely ignore or you can 
- [ ] **Are these Stat orders??** 
- [ ] **Do I need to order this?** Like Real Life 
- [ ] Now this is a slightly different thing (remove statistics)
- [ ] Keep Searching and sign
- [ ] Probably want to see lab results now 
- [ ] Results review on the left 
- [ ] Meant to be a shell for basic function not the point of the study 
- [ ] you might want to order (dka orderset) 
- [ ] diet NPO 
- [ ] Sodium Chloride 
- [ ] Sense of Basic Functionaliy
- [ ] Real test and see what happens 
- [ ] Person Orders (everything you did before)

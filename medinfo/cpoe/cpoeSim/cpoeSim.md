# Computerized Provider Order Entry Simulation Tables

## Overview
Additional tables to capture and represent data related to simulated a physician doing clinical order entry
into an interactive system with (simulated) patient cases.
Depends on the clinical_item table framework to represent core (order) data.
Can setup blank data tables from the schema definitions, but should
be better off restoring from a prior dev database dump that includes sample patient case data.
